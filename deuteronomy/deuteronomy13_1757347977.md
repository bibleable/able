## Deuteronomy 13:1
Moses says, if a teacher or a dream man comes and shows a big sign or a wow thing ✨
## Deuteronomy 13:2
And if the sign comes true, but he says, “let’s go follow other gods and pray to them,” do not go 🗿❌
## Deuteronomy 13:3
Do not listen to him. God is testing you to see if you love God with your whole heart ❤️🧪
## Deuteronomy 13:4
Follow God. Respect Him. Keep His rules. Listen to Him. Serve Him. Stay close to Him 👣🙏👂🤝
## Deuteronomy 13:5
That fake teacher tried to pull you from God. You must stop him; he must die. Take away the bad from your land ⚖️✋❌
## Deuteronomy 13:6
If your brother, your son, your daughter, your wife, or your best friend whispers, “let’s go pray to other gods,” do not go 🤫👨‍👩‍👧‍👦🧑‍🤝‍🧑🗿
## Deuteronomy 13:7
Those gods may be from near or far, from any place on earth 🌍↔️
## Deuteronomy 13:8
Do not say yes. Do not listen. Do not feel sorry. Do not hide the one who asks you 🙅‍♂️👂❌
## Deuteronomy 13:9
You must be first to stop him. Then all the people help 🪨👥
## Deuteronomy 13:10
Throw rocks at him until he dies, because he tried to pull you from God 🪨🚫
## Deuteronomy 13:11
All the people will hear and be afraid, and they will not do this bad thing again 👂😟❌
## Deuteronomy 13:12
If you hear that a town God gives you has people doing this bad thing 🏙️👂
## Deuteronomy 13:13
Bad people came and said, “let’s go pray to other gods,” and they pulled the town away 🚶‍♂️🗣️🗿
## Deuteronomy 13:14
Check it well. Ask many questions. Make sure it is true 🕵️‍♂️❓✅
## Deuteronomy 13:15
If it is true, fight that town. Use swords. Destroy it all ⚔️🏙️🔥
## Deuteronomy 13:16
Put all the stuff in the town center. Burn the town and the stuff for God. Leave it as a pile. Do not build it again 🧱➡️🔥🗑️🚫

Do not keep any of the stuff. Then God will stop being angry. He will be kind and help your big family, like He said ✋👜❌🙂❤️👶
## Deuteronomy 13:18
This will happen if you listen to God, keep His rules, and do what is right 👂📜✅
