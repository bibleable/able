## Isaiah 64:1
Isaiah talked to God: God, please open the sky and come down. Make the big hills shake. 🙏🌌⬇️⛰️
## Isaiah 64:2
Like fire burns sticks and makes water get hot and bubble. Make bad men know You. Make all lands shake. 🔥🌿💧🔊😮
## Isaiah 64:3
Long ago, You did big things we did not guess. You came down, and the hills shook. ⏳🌟⬇️⛰️
## Isaiah 64:4
No one has seen a God like You. You help people who wait for You. 👀🚫🙌⏱️
## Isaiah 64:5
You meet people who are glad to do right and who remember Your way. But You were mad. We did wrong for a long time. Can You save us? 🙂➡️👍🛣️😠😔⏳❓
## Isaiah 64:6
We are not clean. Even our good things are like a dirty cloth. We fall like a leaf. Our wrongs blow us away like wind. 🧼❌🧻🟤🍂💨
## Isaiah 64:7
No one calls Your name. No one holds on to You. You hid Your face from us. Our wrongs made us weak. 📣❌✋❌🙈😞
## Isaiah 64:8
But now, Lord, You are our Father. We are like clay. You are the pot maker. We are the work of Your hands. 👨‍👧‍👦🏺👐
## Isaiah 64:9
Lord, please do not be very mad. Do not keep our wrongs forever. Please look at us. We are Your people. 🙏😟🛑🕰️👀👥
## Isaiah 64:10
Your special towns are now like empty land. Zion is empty. Jerusalem is sad and broken. 🏙️➡️🌾😢🏚️
## Isaiah 64:11
Your special nice house is burned. Our dads sang to You there. All the nice places are broken. 🏠🔥🎶👨‍👧‍👦💔
## Isaiah 64:12
Lord, will You stay quiet about this? Will You say nothing? Will You let us hurt so much? 🤫❓😢
