## Psalms 53:1
David sings: Some people say, “No God.” They do bad. They do not do good. 🚫🗣️👎

All people went the wrong way. All do bad. No one does good. 🚶‍♂️➡️❌👎
## Psalms 53:4
Bad people do not learn. They hurt God’s people like eating bread. They do not pray to God. 😠🍞🙅‍♂️
## Psalms 53:5
Then the bad ones get very scared, even when no one is there. God breaks the plan of the ones who fight you by your camp. You make them feel bad, for God says no to them. 😨🏕️✋
## Psalms 53:6
Oh, I want God to send help from His hill. When God brings His people back and makes things good again, Jacob and Israel will be glad. 🗻🆘😊
