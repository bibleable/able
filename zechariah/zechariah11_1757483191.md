## Zechariah 11:1
God says to a land named Lebanon: open your doors. Fire will burn your big trees. 🚪🔥🌲
## Zechariah 11:2
Cry, little trees and big trees. The big trees in Bashan fall down. The thick woods are cut. 😢🌳🪵✂️
## Zechariah 11:3
Hear the sheep leaders cry. Their good place is gone. Hear lions roar by the Jordan. The brush is smashed. 🐑😭🦁🌿
## Zechariah 11:4
God tells Zechariah to be a sheep leader for sad, hurt sheep. 🐑👣
## Zechariah 11:5
Bad men buy the sheep and kill them. Bad men sell them and say, “We are rich.” Their sheep leaders do not care. 💰😠⚔️
## Zechariah 11:6
God says, I will not stop the hurt now. People will fight each other. A king will be mean. The land will be broken. I will not save them then. ⚔️😢🏙️💥
## Zechariah 11:7
So I led the sad sheep. I took two sticks. I named one Good. I named one Together. I took care of the sheep. 🐑🪵🪵
## Zechariah 11:8
In one moon, I stopped three bad sheep leaders. I was tired of them. They did not like me. 🌙➕➕➕🚫
## Zechariah 11:9
I said, I will not lead you now. Let the sick die. Let the weak fall. The rest will hurt each other very, very bad. 💔⚠️
## Zechariah 11:10
I broke the stick named Good. This ended the big promise. 🪵💔
## Zechariah 11:11
That day, the careful sheep knew God had spoken. 👀🙏
## Zechariah 11:12
I said, Pay me if you want. If not, do not. They paid me 30 silver coins. 🪙🪙🪙
## Zechariah 11:13
God said, Throw the money to the potter at God’s house. This pay is not kind. I threw the 30 coins in God’s house for the potter. 🪙➡️🏠🏺
## Zechariah 11:14
Then I broke the stick named Together. The two groups, Judah and Israel, did not stay like brothers. 🪵💔👬❌
## Zechariah 11:15
God said, Now act like a silly, bad sheep leader. 🎭🐑
## Zechariah 11:16
A bad sheep leader will come. He will not help hurt ones. He will not look for lost ones. He will not heal. He will not feed. He will hurt the sheep, even take their feet. 😡🐑❌🦶
## Zechariah 11:17
Bad sheep leader, big trouble to you! A sword will hit his arm and eye. His arm will dry up. His right eye will be blind. ⚔️💪❌👁️❌
