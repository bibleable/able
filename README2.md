Read the ABLE verses from each .md file of each folder inside folder `paraphrases`. ABLE is a bible paraphrase for special needs. Keep the simplicity of each verse because it is for intellectual disable and young learners. Keep the emoji. 

Write a single, simple narrative that flows from start to end, using appropriate, simple conjunction, referencing each used verse with its verse number in parentheses. e.g. (1:1)

Save the story to the `stories/<name_of_book>` folder using the source filename as the base name.

Follow this format: 

- A brief introduction of the story
- A story with simple conjunction 
- Questions and reflection for each story
- answer
