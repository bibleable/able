## Revelation 5:1
John saw God on His big seat. In His right hand was a roll book. It had words on both sides. It had 7 seals. 👑✋📜7🔒
## Revelation 5:2
A strong angel shouted, “Who can open the roll and break the 7 seals?” 🗣️👼📜7❓
## Revelation 5:3
No one in the sky, on the earth, or under the ground could open it or look in it. 🌌🌍⛰️🙅
## Revelation 5:4
I, John, cried a lot, because no one could open the roll or look in it. 😭
## Revelation 5:5
One old leader said to me, “Do not cry. Look! The Lion from Judah, from David’s family, won. He can open the roll and the 7 seals.” 🦁👑📜7🔓
## Revelation 5:6
Then I saw a Lamb. This is Jesus. He stood near the big seat, with the four living ones and the old men. He looked like He had been hurt and killed. He had 7 horns and 7 eyes. The eyes are God's Holy Spirit sent out to all the earth. 🐑✝️👀7🕊️🌍
## Revelation 5:7
He went and took the roll from God’s right hand. ✋📜
## Revelation 5:8
When He took it, the four living ones and the 24 old men fell down to praise Him. Each had a harp. Each had gold bowls with sweet smell. The sweet smell is the prayers of God’s people. 🎵🪈🥣✨🙏

They sang a new song to Jesus: “You can take the roll and open it. You died for us. Your blood paid for people for God. You saved people from every group and land.” 🎶❤️🌍

They said in a loud voice: “The Lamb who died is worthy! Give Him power, money, wise mind, strength, honor, glory, and praise!” 🐑📣💪💰🧠✨🙌

The four living ones said, “Amen!” The 24 old men fell down and praised. 🙏🙌
