## Revelation 9:1
John saw the 5th angel blow a trumpet. 🎺 A star fell from the sky and got a key to a deep pit. ⭐🔑
## Revelation 9:2
The angel opened the pit. Smoke came out, like a big fire. 🌫️🔥 The sun and sky got dark. ☀️⬛
## Revelation 9:3
From the smoke came big bugs called locusts. 🐛 They could sting like a scorpion. 🦂
## Revelation 9:4
The locusts were told, “Do not hurt the grass or trees. 🌿🌳 Hurt only people who do not have God’s mark.”
## Revelation 9:5
They could not kill. They could only hurt people for five months. ⏳ It felt like a scorpion sting. 🤕
## Revelation 9:6
In that time, people wanted to die, but they could not. 😞 Death ran away from them.
## Revelation 9:7
The locusts looked like little horses ready to fight. 🐎 They had small gold crowns. 👑 Their faces looked like men.
## Revelation 9:8
They had long hair. 💇‍♀️ Their teeth were like a lion. 🦁
## Revelation 9:9
They wore armor like iron. 🛡️ The sound of their wings was like many chariots (horse carts) running fast. 🐎💨
## Revelation 9:10
Their tails were like scorpions with stings. 🦂 They could hurt people for five months. ⏳
## Revelation 9:11
They had a king, the angel of the deep pit. 👑 In Hebrew his name is Abaddon. In Greek his name is Apollyon.
## Revelation 9:12
One sad time is done. Two more sad times will come. ⏭️
## Revelation 9:13
The 6th angel blew his trumpet. 🎺 John heard a voice from God’s gold altar.
## Revelation 9:14
The voice said, “Let the four angels go free. They are at the big river called Euphrates.” 🌊
## Revelation 9:15
The four angels went out. They were ready for that time. ⏰ They were allowed to make many people die.
## Revelation 9:16
John saw a very big army on horses. 🐎 There were so many riders. He heard the number. It was huge.

## Revelation 9:19
The horses had power in their mouths and tails. Their tails were like snakes with heads. 🐍 They hurt people.
## Revelation 9:20
The other people who did not die still did not say sorry. They kept praying to fake gods they made from gold, silver, stone, and wood. 🗿 These things cannot see, hear, or walk.
## Revelation 9:21
They still did not stop doing very bad things. They hurt and killed. They did bad magic. ✨ They did wrong love. They took things that were not theirs.
