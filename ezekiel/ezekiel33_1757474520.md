## Ezekiel 33:1
God spoke to Ezekiel again. 🗣️
## Ezekiel 33:2
God said: Tell the people a story. In a land, they pick a man to watch the wall. He is a watchman. 👀🏰
## Ezekiel 33:3
When the watchman sees the enemy come, he blows a horn to warn the town. 📯⚠️
## Ezekiel 33:4
If a person hears the horn but does not run to be safe, he will get hurt. It is his own fault. 🏃‍♂️❌
## Ezekiel 33:5
He heard the horn but did not listen. He gets hurt. If he had listened, he would be safe. 👂➡️🚫/🛡️
## Ezekiel 33:6
If the watchman sees danger and does not blow the horn, people will die. God says the watchman did wrong. 👀🚫📯⚔️
## Ezekiel 33:7
God said: Ezekiel, I made you a watchman for Israel. Hear My words and tell them. 👂🗣️
## Ezekiel 33:8
If I say, “Bad man, you will die,” and you do not tell him, he will die, and I will say you did not tell. ☠️🗣️
## Ezekiel 33:9
But if you tell the bad man to stop and he will not stop, he will die for his bad. You will be safe. 🗣️➡️🚫☠️
## Ezekiel 33:10
God said: Say to the people, “You say, We did bad. We feel sad. Can we live?” 😔❓
## Ezekiel 33:11
Say, “God says, I do not like when bad people die. I want them to turn and live. Turn back. Please turn back. Why will you die?” 💔🔁❤️
## Ezekiel 33:12
Say, “If a good man starts to do bad, his good will not save him. If a bad man stops his bad, he will not stay in trouble.” 🔄
## Ezekiel 33:13
If I say to a good man, “You will live,” but he trusts his good and then does wrong, he will die for the wrong. ⚖️☠️
## Ezekiel 33:14
If I say to a bad man, “You will die,” but he stops his bad and does what is right, 🛑➡️👍
## Ezekiel 33:15
If he gives back what he stole and walks in good ways, he will live. He will not die. 🎁🚶‍♂️❤️
## Ezekiel 33:16
I will not count the old bad on him. He did right. He will live. 🧽❤️
## Ezekiel 33:17
But your people say, “God is not fair.” Their way is not fair. 🙅‍♂️⚖️
## Ezekiel 33:18
If a good man turns to bad, he will die for the bad. 🔄☠️
## Ezekiel 33:19
If a bad man turns from bad and does right, he will live. 🔄❤️
## Ezekiel 33:20
You say, “God is not fair.” But I will say what is right for each one, by what he does. 👤⚖️
## Ezekiel 33:21
Later, a man ran from the city and came to Ezekiel. He said, “The city fell.” 🏃‍♂️🏙️⬇️
## Ezekiel 33:22
The night before he came, God helped Ezekiel speak. My mouth was opened. I could talk. 🗣️✨
## Ezekiel 33:23
God spoke to Ezekiel again. 🗣️📖
## Ezekiel 33:24
God said: People left in the land say, “Abraham was one man and got the land. We are many. The land is ours.” 🧍➡️🌄👥
## Ezekiel 33:25
Say to them: You do bad. You eat in a bad way. You look to fake gods. You hurt people. Do you think you can keep the land? 🍖👀🗿💔
## Ezekiel 33:26
You trust in the sword. You do very bad things. You take your friend’s wife. Will you keep the land? ⚔️🚫💔
## Ezekiel 33:27
Say: People in the land will die by the sword. People in the field will be food for wild animals. People in towns and caves will die by sick. ⚔️🐺🤒
## Ezekiel 33:28
I will make the land empty. The strong power will end. No one will pass by. 🏜️🚫
## Ezekiel 33:29
Then they will know I am God, when the land is empty because they did very bad. 🙏🏜️
## Ezekiel 33:30
God said: Ezekiel, your people talk about you near walls and doors. They say, “Come hear what God says.” 🧍‍♂️🧍‍♀️🚪👂
## Ezekiel 33:31
They come and sit with you. They hear your words, but they do not do them. They say nice words, but they want more stuff. 🪑👂🗣️💰
## Ezekiel 33:32
To them, you are like a nice song with a good voice. They hear you, but they do not do it. 🎵👂🚫
## Ezekiel 33:33
When the words come true, they will know a man of God was with them. 📜✅
