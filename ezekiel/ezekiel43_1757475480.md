## Ezekiel 43:1
The man took me to the east gate. 🧍➡️🚪🌅
## Ezekiel 43:2
I saw God’s bright light come from the east. His voice was loud like big water. The land lit up. 🌅✨🌊🌍

It looked like what I saw before. I fell down on my face. 😲🙏
## Ezekiel 43:4
God’s bright light went into the temple by the east gate. ✨🏛️🌅

God said, “Son of man, this is My seat. I will live here with Israel people for all time. They must not do bad near My name or My house again.” 🪑🏛️👨‍👩‍👧‍👦❌
## Ezekiel 43:8
They put their own places by My house and did very bad things. I was not happy and I stopped them. 🏠❌🏛️
## Ezekiel 43:9
Now they must throw away all bad and all dead-king things. Then I will live with them for all time. 🧹❌🏛️💕
## Ezekiel 43:10
Son of man, show the house to Israel people, so they feel sorry for wrong. Let them look at the plan and check the size. 📐🏛️
## Ezekiel 43:11
If they feel sorry, tell them the rules and the plan. Show doors in and out. Write it so they can do it. 📝🚪➡️⬅️
## Ezekiel 43:12
Here is the big rule: all the hill by the temple is very, very holy. 🏔️✨
## Ezekiel 43:13
These are the sizes of the altar. The man used a big stick to see the size. 📏🗿

The low part was this big. The next part was bigger. 📏⬆️

The top was high, with four horns at the four corners. 🔺4️⃣

The top was a big square. 📦
## Ezekiel 43:17
The edge was wide. It had a small edge around it. The steps faced east. 🪜🌅

God said, “When you build the altar, bring gifts to God and put blood on it.” 🏗️🎁🩸
## Ezekiel 43:19
Give a young bull to the priests from Zadok to fix wrong. 🐂🙏
## Ezekiel 43:20
Put some blood on the four horns, on the corners, and on the edge. This makes the altar clean for God. 🩸🖐️🗿

Take the bull outside the holy room and burn it there. 🔥🐂
## Ezekiel 43:22
Day two: bring a goat to fix wrong. Clean the altar the same way. 🐐🩸

When it is clean, bring a young bull and a ram with no bad spots. 🐂🐏
## Ezekiel 43:24
Give them to God. The priests will put salt on them and burn them. 🧂🔥
## Ezekiel 43:25
Do this for seven days: each day bring a goat, a bull, and a ram to fix wrong. 7️⃣🐐🐂🐏
## Ezekiel 43:26
For seven days they make the altar clean and ready for God. 🗓️🧼🗿
## Ezekiel 43:27
After that, from day eight on, the priests will bring gifts to God. God says, “I will say yes to you.” 🎁🙏💖
