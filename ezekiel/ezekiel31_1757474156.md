## Ezekiel 31:1
In year 11, month 3, day 1, God spoke to Ezekiel. 📅✨
## Ezekiel 31:2
God said, Ezekiel, talk to Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, and his many people. Ask, Who are you like, you who think you are so big? 🗣️👑
## Ezekiel 31:3
Long ago, Assyria was like a big cedar tree in a hill land named Lebanon. It was very tall, with big branches and cool shade, and its top touched the clouds. 🌲⛰️☁️
## Ezekiel 31:4
Water made the tree grow tall. Rivers and streams fed it well. 💧🌊🌲
## Ezekiel 31:5
The tree grew taller than all the other trees. Its branches were many, because it had lots of water. 🌲⬆️💧
## Ezekiel 31:6
Birds made nests in its branches. Animals had babies under it. Many people sat in its shade. 🐦🪺🐾🍼🧍‍♂️🧍‍♀️
## Ezekiel 31:7
The tree looked so good and strong. Its roots went down to the water. 🌲💪🌊
## Ezekiel 31:8
No tree in God’s garden was like this tree. It was the best one. 🌳🌳🌲⭐
## Ezekiel 31:9
God made the tree very pretty. Other trees wanted to be like it. 🌲✨👀
## Ezekiel 31:10
So God said, The tree got proud and loved being so high. 🗣️🌲😌
## Ezekiel 31:11
God will give the tree to a strong man from a far land. He will bring it down. God sent it away for its bad way. 💪🌍⬇️
## Ezekiel 31:12
Men from a far land cut the tree down. Its branches fell on the hills and in the low places. All the people ran away from its shade. 🪓🌲💥⛰️🏃‍♂️🏃‍♀️
## Ezekiel 31:13
Now birds sit on the fallen trunk, and animals rest on the fallen branches. 🐦🌲🛌🐾
## Ezekiel 31:14
This is to show: do not be too proud. All big trees will one day go down to the deep pit, like people do. 🚫😌🌲⬇️🕳️
## Ezekiel 31:15
On the day the tree went down to the pit, God made the water stop. The hill land was dark and sad. Other trees were weak. 🌑💧✋😢
## Ezekiel 31:16
Many lands shook with fear when the tree fell. The trees in the deep place felt better there. 🌍😨🌲🕳️
## Ezekiel 31:17
Friends of the tree went down too, to the deep place. Many were killed by the sword. 🧍‍♂️⬇️🕳️⚔️
## Ezekiel 31:18
So, Pharaoh, who are you like now? You will go down too, with the other trees. You will lie with those who were killed. 👑⬇️🕳️⚔️
