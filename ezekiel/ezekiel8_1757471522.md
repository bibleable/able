## Ezekiel 8:1
I, Ezekiel, sat at my house. The old leaders sat with me. Then God put His hand on me. 🏠👴👴✋✨
## Ezekiel 8:2
I looked. I saw a bright Man. His top looked like shiny light. His legs looked like fire. ✨🔥
## Ezekiel 8:3
He reached out His hand and held my hair. He lifted me up between sky and ground. God showed me Jerusalem. He took me to God’s house at the north gate. I saw a bad statue that made God sad and mad. ✋🙆‍♂️🛫🌌🏙️⛪🧭🗿😠
## Ezekiel 8:4
I saw God’s bright glory there. It looked like what I saw before. ✨🙏
## Ezekiel 8:5
God said, “Look to the north.” I looked and I saw the bad statue by the gate. 👀🧭🚪🗿
## Ezekiel 8:6
God said, “Do you see this? The people do very bad things in My house. I will show you more bad things.” 😢⛪🚫
## Ezekiel 8:7
God took me to a wall. I saw a small hole in the wall. 🚶‍♂️🧱🕳️
## Ezekiel 8:8
God said, “Dig the wall.” I dug the wall and found a door. 🛠️🧱🚪
## Ezekiel 8:9
God said, “Go in. See the very bad things they do.” 🚶‍♂️🚪😞
## Ezekiel 8:10
I went in. I saw pictures of bugs, animals, and fake gods on the walls all around. 🐜🐍🐺🖼️🗿
## Ezekiel 8:11
Seventy old leaders stood there. A man named Jaazaniah was there too. Each man held a smoke pot. Thick sweet smoke went up. 👴7️⃣0️⃣🫙🌫️
## Ezekiel 8:12
God said, “Do you see what the old leaders do in the dark? They say, ‘God does not see us. God left our land.’” 🌑🙈
## Ezekiel 8:13
God said, “Come. I will show even worse things.” 👉😞
## Ezekiel 8:14
God took me to the gate of God’s house. Women sat there. They cried for a fake god named Tammuz. 🚪👩‍🦱😭🗿
## Ezekiel 8:15
God said, “Did you see this? I will show even worse things.” 👀➡️😣
## Ezekiel 8:16
God took me inside the yard of God’s house. By the door, about 25 men stood. They turned their backs to God’s house. They faced east. They bowed to the sun. ⛪🚶‍♂️🚶‍♂️↩️🧭➡️☀️🙏
## Ezekiel 8:17
God said, “Do you see? The people do very bad things. The land is full of hurt. They make Me mad. They even do a rude nose thing.” 😡🌍🤕👃
## Ezekiel 8:18
God said, “So I will punish. I will not spare. I will not feel sorry. They may cry loud, but I will not hear.” ⚖️⛔😠🙉
