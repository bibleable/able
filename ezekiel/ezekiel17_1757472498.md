## Ezekiel 17:1
God spoke to Ezekiel. 📣🙏
## Ezekiel 17:2
God said, Tell a picture story to the people of Israel. 📖👂
## Ezekiel 17:3
God said, Here is the story: A big bird came. It had big wings. It flew to a tall tree and took a small top twig. 🦅🌳✂️
## Ezekiel 17:4
The big bird took the twig far away. He put it in a big city. 🦅✈️🌱🏙️
## Ezekiel 17:5
He took seed from the land. He put it in good dirt by much water. 🌱🪴💧
## Ezekiel 17:6
The seed grew. It was a low plant. Its arms went toward the big bird. Its roots stayed there. 🌿⬇️🦅
## Ezekiel 17:7
Then a new big bird came. The plant turned to the new bird. It reached out to get water from him. 🦅➡️🌿💧
## Ezekiel 17:8
But the plant was in good dirt. It had much water. It could make fruit and be strong. 🪴💧🍇💪
## Ezekiel 17:9
God said, Will it do well? No. It will be pulled up. Its fruit will be cut off. It will dry up. It will be easy to pull out. ❌🌿✂️🥀
## Ezekiel 17:10
It is planted, yes. But a hot wind will hit it. It will dry up right there. 🌬️🔥🥀
## Ezekiel 17:11
God spoke to Ezekiel again. 📣🙏
## Ezekiel 17:12
God said, Tell Israel the meaning. The king of Babylon came to the city Jerusalem. He took the king and the leaders. He took them to Babylon. 👑🏙️➡️🏙️
## Ezekiel 17:13
The big king chose a young king. He made a promise with him. The young king said yes. The big king also took strong men away. 🤝👑✋➡️💪
## Ezekiel 17:14
The plan was this: the land would be small and quiet. The young king must keep the promise. Then the land could stand. 🏞️🤫✅
## Ezekiel 17:15
But the young king broke the promise. He sent men to Egypt to ask for many horses and men with swords. Will he do well? No. ❌🤝➡️🇪🇬🐎🗡️
## Ezekiel 17:16
God said, I live. The young king will die in Babylon. He will die where the big king lives, because he broke the promise. ⚖️🏙️☠️
## Ezekiel 17:17
The king of Egypt will not help him in war. Walls will go up. Many will be hurt. The help will not come. 🧱⚔️🚫
## Ezekiel 17:18
He said yes with his hand. Then he broke the promise. He will not get away. ✋🤝❌🚫
## Ezekiel 17:19
God said, He broke My promise. I will bring it back on his own head. 🗣️⚖️🔁
## Ezekiel 17:20
God said, I will catch him like a net. I will take him to Babylon. I will say what is right there for the wrong he did to Me. 🕸️🚓🏙️⚖️
## Ezekiel 17:21
His men will fall by swords. The rest will run far away. Then you will know I am God. I said it. 🗡️🏃‍♂️🌬️🙏
## Ezekiel 17:22
God said, I will take a small top twig from a tall tree. I will plant it on a high hill. 🌱🌳⛰️
## Ezekiel 17:23
I will plant it in the land. It will grow big. It will make fruit. Birds will sit and make homes in its shade. 🏞️🌳🍇🐦🏡
## Ezekiel 17:24
Then all trees will know I am God. I make the tall tree low. I make the small tree tall. I make the dry tree grow. I said it. I will do it. 🌳⬇️🌱⬆️🌵➡️🌿🙏
