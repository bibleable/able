Paul said: About food from fake gods. You say, “We all know.” 🧠 But knowing can make us proud 😕. God’s love helps people and makes us kind 😊.
## 1 Corinthians 8:2
If you think you know it all, you do not know it all yet. 🧠❌
## 1 Corinthians 8:3
If you love God, God knows you. ❤️🙏
## 1 Corinthians 8:4
About eating that food: fake gods are nothing 🗿❌. There is one God. Only one. 1️⃣
## 1 Corinthians 8:5
Some people say there are many gods in the sky or on the earth 🌌🌍. People call many things “gods” and “bosses.”
## 1 Corinthians 8:6
But for us, there is one God, the Father. All things come from Him, and we live for Him. And there is one Jesus. All things came by Him, and we live by Him. ✝️💖
## 1 Corinthians 8:7
Not all people know this. Some ate food for fake gods before. When they eat now, they still think it is for fake gods. Their hearts feel weak and bad. 🍽️😟
## 1 Corinthians 8:8
Food does not make us near God. If we eat or do not eat, we are the same to God. 🍞🤝
## 1 Corinthians 8:9
But be careful. What you do can make a weak friend trip. 🚫👣
## 1 Corinthians 8:10
If a weak friend sees you, the one who knows, eat in a fake god house, they may think it is okay. They may copy you, even when their heart says no. 🏛️🗿👀
## 1 Corinthians 8:11
Then your weak friend—the one Jesus died for—can get hurt by what you do. ❤️✝️
## 1 Corinthians 8:12
When you hurt weak friends like this, you do wrong to them, and you do wrong to Jesus. 😢✝️
## 1 Corinthians 8:13
So if my food makes my friend fall, I will not eat meat again. 🍖❌ I do not want to make my friend fall.
