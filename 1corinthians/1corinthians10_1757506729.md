## 1 Corinthians 10:1
Paul says, Friends, remember long ago. A big cloud was with God’s people. They walked by the sea. ☁️🌊
## 1 Corinthians 10:2
They were with Moses. The cloud and sea were like a bath to show this. ☁️🌊🛁
## 1 Corinthians 10:3
God gave them the same special food. 🍞
## 1 Corinthians 10:4
God gave them the same special drink. Water came from a rock. The Rock was Jesus. 💧🪨✝️
## 1 Corinthians 10:5
But God was not happy with many of them. They fell in the big dry land. 😔🏜️
## 1 Corinthians 10:6
These are lessons for us. Do not want to do bad. 📘✋
## 1 Corinthians 10:7
Do not bow to fake gods. Do not make a bad party like they did. 🚫🗿🎉
## 1 Corinthians 10:8
Do not do wrong with your body. Many, many died that day. 🚫🙅‍♂️
## 1 Corinthians 10:9
Do not test the Lord Jesus. Some did. Snakes bit them. ✝️🚫🐍
## 1 Corinthians 10:10
Do not cry and fuss at God. Some did, and they were hurt. 😢🚫
## 1 Corinthians 10:11
These things were written to help us learn. We live now. Learn from them. 📝👀
## 1 Corinthians 10:12
If you think you are strong, be careful. You may fall. ⚠️
## 1 Corinthians 10:13
Hard tests come to all. God is good. He will help you say no. He will make a way out. 💪🚪
## 1 Corinthians 10:14
My dear friends, run from fake gods. 🏃‍♀️🗿🚫
## 1 Corinthians 10:15
You are smart. Think about this. 🤔
## 1 Corinthians 10:16
We share the cup to thank Jesus. We share the bread. We think of Jesus’ blood and body. 🥖🍷✝️
## 1 Corinthians 10:17
We share one bread. So we are one group. 🤝🥖
## 1 Corinthians 10:18
Look at God’s people long ago. They ate gifts to God on the big God table. They shared. 🍖🕯️
## 1 Corinthians 10:19
Do I mean fake gods are real? No. ❌🗿
## 1 Corinthians 10:20
Some give food to bad spirits, not to God. Do not join bad spirits. 👿🚫
## 1 Corinthians 10:21
You cannot share with Jesus and bad spirits too. ✝️🚫👿
## 1 Corinthians 10:22
Do not make the Lord mad or sad. We are not stronger than Him. 😠➡️🙏
## 1 Corinthians 10:23
You may say, “I can do it.” But it may not help. It may not build up. 🧱⬆️
## 1 Corinthians 10:24
Do not just think of self. Help others. ❤️🙌
## 1 Corinthians 10:25
Eat food from the store. Do not worry or ask a lot. 🛒🍗
## 1 Corinthians 10:26
The world is the Lord’s. It is His. 🌍✝️
## 1 Corinthians 10:27
If a person who does not know God asks you to eat, you can go. Eat what is there. Do not ask a lot. 🍽️🙂
## 1 Corinthians 10:28
But if someone says, “This food was for a fake god,” then do not eat. Do it to help that person. ✋🗿🚫
## 1 Corinthians 10:29
Your heart is free with God. But care for their heart too. 💗🤝
## 1 Corinthians 10:30
If I thank God for food, why blame me? But still, I care for others. 🙏🍽️
## 1 Corinthians 10:31
So eat, drink, live. Do all for God. 🥤🍽️✨
## 1 Corinthians 10:32
Do not make any group mad: Jew, Greek, or God’s church. 🤝
## 1 Corinthians 10:33
I try to help all. I do not seek self. I want many to be saved by Jesus. 🙂✝️
