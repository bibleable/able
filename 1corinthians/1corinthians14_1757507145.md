## 1 Corinthians 14:1
Paul says: Love first. Ask God for gifts. Want most to speak God’s words that help people. ❤️🗣️
## 1 Corinthians 14:2
If you use other talk no one knows, you talk to God, not people; no one gets it; you say secret things with God. 🗣️🔐🙏
## 1 Corinthians 14:3
If you speak God’s words, you help people be strong, you help them, you make sad hearts feel better. 🗣️💪🙂
## 1 Corinthians 14:4
Other talk helps only you; God’s words help the whole church be strong. 🧍➡️⛪💪
## 1 Corinthians 14:5
I wish you all could use other talk, but I want more that you speak God’s words; if other talk is explained, then it helps like that too. 🗣️📝🙂
## 1 Corinthians 14:6
Family, if I come and only use other talk, I do not help you; I must bring a new word from God, or learning, or teaching you can use. 🚶‍♂️🗣️➡️📖🧠
## 1 Corinthians 14:7
Think of a flute or a harp; if notes are not clear, who knows the song? 🎶🎼❓
## 1 Corinthians 14:8
If a trumpet sound is not clear, who will get ready to fight? 🎺⚔️❓
## 1 Corinthians 14:9
So you too: if your words are not clear, who can know what you say? You are just talking to the air. 💬🌬️
## 1 Corinthians 14:10
There are many kinds of talk in the world, and each talk has a meaning. 🌍🗣️🔤
## 1 Corinthians 14:11
If I do not know the meaning, we are like strangers to each other. 🧍‍♂️↔️🧍‍♀️
## 1 Corinthians 14:12
You all want gifts from God; try most of all to help the church be strong. 🎁⛪💪
## 1 Corinthians 14:13
So, the one who uses other talk should pray to also explain it. 🙏🗣️📝
## 1 Corinthians 14:14
If I pray in other talk, my heart prays, but my mind does not learn. 🙏❤️🤷‍♂️
## 1 Corinthians 14:15
So I will pray with my heart and my mind; I will sing with my heart and my mind. 🙏🎵❤️🧠
## 1 Corinthians 14:16
If you thank God with words no one knows, new people cannot say “Amen,” because they do not know what you said. 🙏❓🙋‍♂️
## 1 Corinthians 14:17
You thank God well, but the other person is not helped. 🙏👍➡️🚫👥
## 1 Corinthians 14:18
I thank God I use other talk more than all of you. 🙌🗣️
## 1 Corinthians 14:19
But in church, I want five clear words to teach others, not many words no one knows. ⛪5️⃣🗣️✅
## 1 Corinthians 14:20
Family, do not think like little kids; be like babies about bad things, but think like grown-ups. 👶🚫😈🧠🧑
## 1 Corinthians 14:21
God’s rules say: “I will use other talk and other lips to speak to this people, but they still will not listen,” says God. 📖🗣️👂❌
## 1 Corinthians 14:22
So, other talk is a sign for people who do not believe; God’s words are for people who do believe. 🪧🗣️✅
## 1 Corinthians 14:23
If all of you use other talk and new people or people who do not believe come in, they will say you are not okay. ⛪🗣️🗣️🗣️😵
## 1 Corinthians 14:24
But if all of you speak God’s words, and a new person comes, he will feel sorry for wrong and will think about his life. 🗣️🫢🤔
## 1 Corinthians 14:25
His secret heart things will show; he will bow down and worship God and say, “God is here with you!” 🙇‍♂️🙏✨
## 1 Corinthians 14:26
So, family, when you meet, some have a song, some a lesson, some a new word, some other talk, some an explain; do all to help the church be strong. 🎵📖🗣️📝⛪💪
## 1 Corinthians 14:27
If people use other talk, only two or three, and take turns, and someone must explain. 2️⃣3️⃣🔁📝
## 1 Corinthians 14:28
If no one can explain, be quiet in church; talk to yourself and to God. 🤫⛪🙏
## 1 Corinthians 14:29
Two or three who speak God’s words may talk, and the others should think and check the words. ✌️➕☝️🧠✅
## 1 Corinthians 14:30
If a new word comes to someone sitting, the first one should stop and wait. ✋🪑➡️🗣️
## 1 Corinthians 14:31
You can all speak God’s words one by one, so all can learn and all can feel brave. 1️⃣by1️⃣📖🙂
## 1 Corinthians 14:32
The speaker can control himself; he can stop and wait. 🗣️⏸️🧠
## 1 Corinthians 14:33
God makes peace, not mix-up; this is for all the churches of God’s people. 🕊️✅
## 1 Corinthians 14:34
Women should be quiet in the church; they should listen and learn, like God’s rules say. 👩🤫⛪📖
## 1 Corinthians 14:35
If a woman wants to learn, she should ask her own man at home; it is not good for a woman to speak in church. 👩❓🏠👂
## 1 Corinthians 14:36
Did God’s word start with you? Are you the only ones who got it? ❓📖
## 1 Corinthians 14:37
If someone thinks he speaks God’s words or is very close to God, he must know I write God’s rule. 📝📖✅
## 1 Corinthians 14:38
If someone will not listen, then people will not listen to him. 🙉➡️🙅‍♂️
## 1 Corinthians 14:39
So, family, want to speak God’s words, and do not stop people who use other talk. 🗣️👍
## 1 Corinthians 14:40
Do all things in a good and calm way and in order. ✅🕊️
