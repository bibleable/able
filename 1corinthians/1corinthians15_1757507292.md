## 1 Corinthians 15:1
Paul said, I tell you all the good news again. You all got it. You all stand in it. ✝️📖🧍‍♀️🧍‍♂️
## 1 Corinthians 15:2
This good news helps you all be safe with God, if you all keep it. Do not stop. Do not make your trust empty. 🛟🙏
## 1 Corinthians 15:3
I told you first: Jesus died for our bad things, like God’s book said. ✝️📖
## 1 Corinthians 15:4
He was put in a tomb. On day 3 God made Him live again, like God’s book said. 🪦3️⃣🌅
## 1 Corinthians 15:5
He was seen by Peter. Then His twelve friends saw Him. 👀🧔👥
## 1 Corinthians 15:6
Then 500 people saw Him at one time. Most are alive now. Some have died. 👀👥👥👥
## 1 Corinthians 15:7
Then James saw Him. Then all His special helpers saw Him. 🧔👀👥
## 1 Corinthians 15:8
Last, I, Paul, saw Him too. I was very late. ✍️👀
## 1 Corinthians 15:9
I am the least helper. I hurt God’s church before. 😔⛪
## 1 Corinthians 15:10
But God was kind to me. I am me by God. I worked hard, but God worked in me. 💖💪
## 1 Corinthians 15:11
So if it is me or them, we say the same. You all said yes and trust. 🗣️✅
## 1 Corinthians 15:12
We say Jesus lived again. Why do some say dead people do not live again? ❓🌅
## 1 Corinthians 15:13
If dead people do not live again, then Jesus did not live again. 🚫🌅
## 1 Corinthians 15:14
If Jesus did not live again, our talk is empty, and your trust is empty. 🗣️❌
## 1 Corinthians 15:15
Then we would be liars about God, for we said God made Jesus live again. That would not be true if dead people do not live again. ❌🗣️
## 1 Corinthians 15:16
If the dead do not live again, then Jesus did not live again. 🔁🚫🌅
## 1 Corinthians 15:17
If Jesus did not live again, your trust is empty. You still have your bad things. 😟
## 1 Corinthians 15:18
Then people who died with Jesus would be lost. 💔💀
## 1 Corinthians 15:19
If our hope in Jesus is only for now, we are very sad people. 😢
## 1 Corinthians 15:20
But Jesus did live again! He is first, and many who died will live again too. 🌅🏆😊
## 1 Corinthians 15:21
A man, Adam, brought death. A man, Jesus, brings life again. 🧑➡️💀 | Jesus ➡️🌅
## 1 Corinthians 15:22
All in Adam die. All in Jesus will live. 💀➡️🌅
## 1 Corinthians 15:23
There is a plan. Jesus is first. Later, His people will live when He comes. ⏱️👑🌅
## 1 Corinthians 15:24
Then the end comes. Jesus gives the kingdom to God the Father. He stops all bad rule and power. 👑➡️🪘🙌
## 1 Corinthians 15:25
Jesus must be King. He wins over all His enemies. 👑⚔️✅
## 1 Corinthians 15:26
The last enemy is death. It will be gone. 💀🚫
## 1 Corinthians 15:27
God put all things under Jesus. But God is not under Jesus. God is over all. ⬇️👑 | God 👆
## 1 Corinthians 15:28
When all is under Jesus, the Son will give it all to God. God will be over all. 👑➡️🙏
## 1 Corinthians 15:29
If dead people do not live, why do some people get wet for dead people? 💧💀❓
## 1 Corinthians 15:30
And why do we face danger all the time? ⚠️⏰
## 1 Corinthians 15:31
I face death each day for our Lord Jesus. ✝️🗓️
## 1 Corinthians 15:32
I fought hard in Ephesus. If the dead do not live, why do that? Then we would just eat and drink, for we die soon. 🥊🏙️🍞🥤
## 1 Corinthians 15:33
Do not be tricked. Bad friends make you act bad. 🚫🧠👎
## 1 Corinthians 15:34
Wake up. Do not do bad. Some do not know God. This is not good. ⏰🚫
## 1 Corinthians 15:35
Some ask, How do the dead live? What body do they get? ❓🧍‍♂️🌅
## 1 Corinthians 15:36
Think. A seed goes in dirt and looks dead. Then it grows. 🌱🪴➡️🌿
## 1 Corinthians 15:37
You plant a seed, not the big plant. You plant a small seed. 🌾➡️🌳
## 1 Corinthians 15:38
God gives each seed a new body, the one He wants. 🌱➡️🌷
## 1 Corinthians 15:39
Not all bodies are the same. People, animals, birds, and fish are all different. 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦🐶🐦🐟
## 1 Corinthians 15:40
There are bodies in the sky and bodies on earth. Each is different. ☀️🌙⭐🌍
## 1 Corinthians 15:41
The sun shines one way. The moon shines another way. Stars shine too, and each star is not the same. ☀️✨🌙⭐
## 1 Corinthians 15:42
It is like this with people who die and live again. The body goes in the ground weak. God raises it new and strong. ⚰️➡️💪
## 1 Corinthians 15:43
It goes down sad and weak. It comes up bright and strong. 😢➡️😊💪
## 1 Corinthians 15:44
It goes down a body like now. It comes up a new body from God. 🧍‍♂️➡️🧍‍♂️✨
## 1 Corinthians 15:45
The first man, Adam, became alive. The last Adam, Jesus, makes people live. 🧑➡️💓 | Jesus ➡️🌅
## 1 Corinthians 15:46
First comes the body like now. After comes the new body from God. ⏩🧍‍♂️➡️🧍‍♂️✨
## 1 Corinthians 15:47
The first man came from dirt. The second man, Jesus our Lord, came from heaven. 🧑🪴 | Jesus 👑⬇️☁️
## 1 Corinthians 15:48
People like Adam are like him. People like Jesus are like Him. 🧍‍♂️➡️🧍‍♂️ | 🧍‍♂️✨➡️🧍‍♂️✨
## 1 Corinthians 15:49
We now look like the first man. One day we will look like Jesus from heaven. 👤➡️👤✨
## 1 Corinthians 15:50
Our bodies now cannot live in God’s kingdom. Weak, bad stuff cannot last forever. 🚫🏰♾️
## 1 Corinthians 15:51
Listen! I tell you a secret. Not all will die. But all will change. 🤫🔔
## 1 Corinthians 15:52
It will be fast, like a blink. A last horn will blow. The dead will live, and we will change. 👁️✨📯🌅
## 1 Corinthians 15:53
This weak body must put on a forever body. 💪➡️♾️
## 1 Corinthians 15:54
When we have the forever body, death is beat. Death is gone. ♾️💀🚫
## 1 Corinthians 15:55
Paul said to death, Hey death, where is your hurt? Hey grave, where did you win? 💀🐝❓🪦❓
## 1 Corinthians 15:56
Death hurts because of bad things. Rules show our bad. 😣📜
## 1 Corinthians 15:57
But thank You, God! God gives us the win by our Lord Jesus Christ. 🙏🏆✝️
## 1 Corinthians 15:58
So, dear friends, stand strong. Do God’s work a lot. Your work for the Lord is not a waste. 🧍‍♂️🧍‍♀️💪❤️
