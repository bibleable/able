## 1 Corinthians 11:1
Paul said, copy me, like I copy Christ. 👣✝️
## 1 Corinthians 11:2
Paul said, good job, you remember me and keep the rules I gave you. 👍📝
## 1 Corinthians 11:3
Paul said, know this: Christ is the head of every man, the man is the head of the woman, and God is the head of Christ. ⛪➡️👨➡️👩➡️God
## 1 Corinthians 11:4
If a man prays or talks for God with a cover on his head, it is not good for him. 🙆‍♂️🎩🚫
## 1 Corinthians 11:5
If a woman prays or talks for God with no cover, it is not good, like her hair is cut off. 🙆‍♀️🚫🧕✂️
## 1 Corinthians 11:6
If a woman will not cover, then she should cut her hair; if that is bad for her, she should cover her head. 🙆‍♀️🧕 or ✂️
## 1 Corinthians 11:7
A man should not cover his head; he shows God’s shine. A woman shows the man’s shine. 👨✨👩✨
## 1 Corinthians 11:8
The first woman came from the man, not the man from the woman. 👨➡️👩
## 1 Corinthians 11:9
The woman was made for the man, not the man for the woman. 👫
## 1 Corinthians 11:10
So a woman should show this with a cover on her head, because of angels. 🧕👼
## 1 Corinthians 11:11
But with the Lord, the woman needs the man, and the man needs the woman. 🤝❤️
## 1 Corinthians 11:12
The first woman came from the man, and now men are born from women; all are from God. 👶➡️👩‍🍼🙏
## 1 Corinthians 11:13
You think about it: Is it good for a woman to pray to God with no cover? 🤔🙆‍♀️🙏
## 1 Corinthians 11:14
You know this: long hair on a man is not good. 👨‍🦱➡️🚫
## 1 Corinthians 11:15
But long hair on a woman is nice. Her hair is like a cover. 👩‍🦰💖
## 1 Corinthians 11:16
If someone wants to fight about this, we will not fight. All God’s churches do it this way. ✋🕊️⛪⛪
## 1 Corinthians 11:17
Now I cannot say good job. Your church time hurts, not helps. ⛪😞
## 1 Corinthians 11:18
When you meet as a church, I hear you split into groups, and I think it is true. ⛪➡️👥👥
## 1 Corinthians 11:19
Some groups may show who does right. ✅❌
## 1 Corinthians 11:20
When you meet, you are not eating the Lord’s meal the right way. 🍞🍷🚫
## 1 Corinthians 11:21
Each one eats first. Some are hungry, and some drink too much. 🍽️😢🍷😵
## 1 Corinthians 11:22
You have homes to eat and drink. Do not shame God’s church or the poor. I will not praise you. 🏠➡️🍽️⛪❤️
## 1 Corinthians 11:23
I got this from the Lord and told you: the Lord Jesus, on the night He was taken, took bread. ✝️🍞
## 1 Corinthians 11:24
He gave thanks, broke it, and He said, <jesus>Take and eat. This is My body for you. Remember Me.</jesus> 🍞🙏
## 1 Corinthians 11:25
After the meal He took the cup and He said, <jesus>This cup is the new way with My blood. When you drink this, remember Me.</jesus> 🍷
## 1 Corinthians 11:26
When you eat this bread and drink this cup, you say Jesus died for us, until He comes. 🍞🍷✝️⏳
## 1 Corinthians 11:27
If you eat and drink in a bad way, you act wrong about Jesus’ body and blood. 🚫🍞🍷
## 1 Corinthians 11:28
Each one should stop and think first. Then eat the bread and drink the cup. ⏸️🤔🍞🍷
## 1 Corinthians 11:29
If you do not see what it means, you get in trouble when you eat and drink. 😕➡️⚠️
## 1 Corinthians 11:30
That is why some of you are weak and sick, and some died. 🤒💔
## 1 Corinthians 11:31
If we check our hearts, the Lord will not need to judge us. 💓🔍
## 1 Corinthians 11:32
When the Lord corrects us, He keeps us safe from the big wrong in the world. ✝️🛡️🌍
## 1 Corinthians 11:33
So, dear ones, when you eat, wait for each other. ⏳👫🍽️
## 1 Corinthians 11:34
If you are very hungry, eat at home first. Then church will be safe, not for trouble. I will tell more when I come. 🏠🍲➡️⛪🙂
