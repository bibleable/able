## Joshua 3:1
Joshua got up early 🌅. He and all the people went to the big river, the Jordan 🌊. They set up camp and waited ⛺.
## Joshua 3:2
After 3 days ⏱️, the leaders walked around the camp ⛺.
## Joshua 3:3
The leaders said, “When you see God’s Box 📦 and God’s helpers carry it, all of you follow it 🚶‍♂️🚶‍♀️.”
## Joshua 3:4
“But stay far from God’s Box. Do not go too near 🙅‍♂️. Then you can see the way. You have not gone this way before 👀.”
## Joshua 3:5
Joshua said, “Get clean and ready 🧼. Tomorrow God will do big things for you ✨.”
## Joshua 3:6
Joshua told God’s helpers, “Pick up God’s Box 📦 and walk in front 🚶‍♂️.” They did it.
## Joshua 3:7
God said to Joshua, “I will make you a big leader today ⭐. I was with Moses. I will be with you too.”
## Joshua 3:8
God said, “Tell the helpers, when your feet touch the edge of the water, stand still in the river 👣🌊.”
## Joshua 3:9
Joshua said to the people, “Come here. Hear God’s words 👂.”
## Joshua 3:10
Joshua said, “This will show the real God is with you. He will push out the big groups in the land 🛡️.”
## Joshua 3:11
“Look! God’s Box will go first into the Jordan River 📦🌊.”
## Joshua 3:12
“Pick 12 men. One man from each big family of Israel 1️⃣2️⃣.”
## Joshua 3:13
“When the helpers’ feet touch the water, the water will stop 🛑🌊. The water will stand like a big pile.”
## Joshua 3:14
The people packed up to cross 🧳. God’s helpers carried God’s Box and walked first 📦🚶‍♂️.
## Joshua 3:15
The helpers came to the river. Their feet got wet at the edge 👣💧. The river was very full then 🌊🌊.
## Joshua 3:16
Then the water from up the river stopped far away and stood like a tall wall 🧱🌊. The water going down to the salt sea stopped too. The people walked across by Jericho 🚶‍♀️🚶‍♂️.
## Joshua 3:17
The helpers stood on dry ground in the middle of the river 🧍‍♂️🧍‍♀️. All the people of Israel walked on dry ground. All of them got across 😊.
