## 1 John 3:1
John says, Look! God loves us so much. He calls us His kids. 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦❤️ The world does not know us, because it did not know Him. 🌎❓
## 1 John 3:2
Dear ones, we are God’s kids now. We do not know yet what we will be. When Jesus comes, we will be like Him. We will see Him. 👀✨
## 1 John 3:3
All who hope in Jesus try to be clean and good, like He is clean and good. 🧼🙂
## 1 John 3:4
If you do wrong, you break God’s rules. Sin is doing wrong. 🚫
## 1 John 3:5
You know Jesus came to take away our sin. In Him there is no sin. ✝️🧼
## 1 John 3:6
If we live in Him, we do not keep doing wrong. If someone keeps doing wrong, they do not know Him. ↩️🚫
## 1 John 3:7
Dear kids, do not let people trick you. The one who does right is right, like Jesus is right. 👍
## 1 John 3:8
The one who does wrong is with the devil. The devil did wrong from the start. God’s Son came to stop the devil’s work. 😈🛑✝️
## 1 John 3:9
If God makes you new, you do not keep doing wrong, because God’s life is in you. You cannot keep doing wrong, because you are God’s child. 🌱➡️🙂
## 1 John 3:10
This shows who are God’s kids and who are the devil’s kids: the one who does not do right is not with God, and the one who does not love his brother or sister is not with God. ⚖️❤️
## 1 John 3:11
This is the message from the start: love one another. ❤️🤝
## 1 John 3:12
Do not be like Cain. He was with the bad one, and he killed his brother. Why? His works were bad, and his brother’s works were good. ⚠️😢
## 1 John 3:13
Dear family, do not be surprised if the world hates you. 🌎💔
## 1 John 3:14
We know we moved from death to life, because we love our brothers and sisters. The one who does not love stays in death. 🕊️❤️
## 1 John 3:15
If you hate your brother or sister, you are like a killer. A killer does not have life with God that lasts forever. 💔⛔
## 1 John 3:16
We know love, because Jesus gave His life for us. So we should help our brothers and sisters, even when it is hard. ✝️➡️❤️
## 1 John 3:17
If someone has money or stuff and sees a brother or sister in need but does not help, how can God's love be in that person? 💰👀🙅
## 1 John 3:18
Dear kids, do not only say, “I love you.” Show love by what you do. Be true. 👐❤️
## 1 John 3:19
This is how we know we are in the true way. Then our hearts can rest before God. 🧡🕊️
## 1 John 3:20
If our hearts say, “You did wrong,” God is bigger than our hearts. He knows all things. 💭➡️🙏
## 1 John 3:21
Dear ones, if our hearts do not blame us, we can come to God with joy. 😀🙏
## 1 John 3:22
We get what we ask from Him, because we keep His rules and do what makes Him glad. 📝🎁
## 1 John 3:23
This is God’s big rule: believe in His Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, just as He told us. 🙏❤️
## 1 John 3:24
The one who keeps God’s rules stays with God, and God stays with them. We know He stays with us, because He gave us God's Holy Spirit. 🏠🕊️
