## 2 Thessalonians 2:1
We talk to you all, friends. Jesus will come. He will bring us to Him. 🙏✨
## 2 Thessalonians 2:2
Do not be upset or afraid by talk or a note that says, “The day of the Lord is here now.” 🗣️📨⏰😟
## 2 Thessalonians 2:3
Do not let anyone trick you. First a big bad time will come. Then a bad man who breaks rules will show. 🚫🎭😈
## 2 Thessalonians 2:4
This bad man fights God. He acts big. He sits in God’s house and says he is god. 🏛️😡🙅‍♂️
## 2 Thessalonians 2:5
You remember I told you this before. 🧠📘
## 2 Thessalonians 2:6
You know what holds him back now. He will be seen at the right time. ✋⏳
## 2 Thessalonians 2:7
Secret bad work is here now. But someone holds it back. Later, that one will step away. 🕵️‍♂️✋➡️
## 2 Thessalonians 2:8
Then the bad man will show. The Lord Jesus will blow with His breath and stop him. Jesus will win when He comes. ✝️💨❌✨
## 2 Thessalonians 2:9
The bad man will come by Satan. He will do fake big signs. 🐍⚠️✨❌
## 2 Thessalonians 2:10
He will trick people who do not love the true way. They do not want to be safe with God. 🎭🚫❤️❌
## 2 Thessalonians 2:11
So God lets them believe the lie. 😕➡️🎭
## 2 Thessalonians 2:12
Then they will have a bad end. They did not pick the true way. They liked to do bad. ❌⚖️➡️
## 2 Thessalonians 2:13
But we thank God for you all. The Lord loves you. God chose you to be saved by God’s Holy Spirit. You trust the true way. 🙏❤️🕊️✔️
## 2 Thessalonians 2:14
