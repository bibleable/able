## 2 Corinthians 4:1
Paul and his friends have a job from God to tell good news. God was kind to them. So they do not quit. 💌💪🙏
## 2 Corinthians 4:2
They say no to bad, secret ways. They do not trick. They tell God’s true word. God sees them. People can see they are true. 👀🗣️✨
## 2 Corinthians 4:3
If the good news looks hidden, it is hidden to people who do not see. 🙈🗞️
## 2 Corinthians 4:4
The bad one in this world makes them not see. Their minds are dark. They do not see the bright good news about Jesus. Jesus shows us God. 😶‍🌫️🚫💡👑
## 2 Corinthians 4:5
Paul and friends do not talk big about themselves. They tell about the Lord Jesus. They are helpers for the people, for Jesus. 🙏🤝
## 2 Corinthians 4:6
Long ago God said, “Let light shine in the dark.” Now God puts light in their hearts. This light helps them know Jesus. When they see Jesus, they see God. 🌗➡️🌞❤️👀
## 2 Corinthians 4:7
They carry this good gift in weak bodies, like jars of mud. This shows God’s power is big. Their power is small. 🏺💡💪
## 2 Corinthians 4:8
They get pushed on all sides, but they are not broken. They get mixed up, but they do not give up. 🔄💥💗
## 2 Corinthians 4:9
People hurt them, but God does not leave them. They get hit down, but they get up again. 🚶‍♂️🙏⬆️
## 2 Corinthians 4:10
They suffer like Jesus. Then the life of Jesus can be seen in them. ✝️➡️💖
## 2 Corinthians 4:11
They face death each day for Jesus. Then Jesus’ life can be seen in their weak bodies. 📅⚠️➡️💖
## 2 Corinthians 4:12
So they get hurt, and the people get life. ❤️‍🩹➡️💚
## 2 Corinthians 4:13
The Bible says, “I believe, so I talk.” They also believe. So they talk. 📖🗣️
## 2 Corinthians 4:14
God made the Lord Jesus live again. God will make them live again with Jesus. God will bring them with the people to Him. ✝️🌅🤝
## 2 Corinthians 4:15
All this is for the people. God is kind to more and more people. Then more and more people say, “Thank You, God!” 🙌💝
## 2 Corinthians 4:16
So they do not quit. Their bodies get weak. But inside they get new each day. 🌄💪💗
## 2 Corinthians 4:17
Their hard time is small and short. God will give a big, forever good life. 🎁⏳➡️🌟
## 2 Corinthians 4:18
They do not look only at things they can see. They look to things they cannot see yet. What they see now will end. God’s things last forever. 👀🚫➡️✨♾️
