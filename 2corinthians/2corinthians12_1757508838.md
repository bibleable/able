## 2 Corinthians 12:1
Paul says, I must tell more. It is not good to brag, but God showed me big things. 📖✨
## 2 Corinthians 12:2
Paul says, I know a man with Christ. 14 years ago, he went up to heaven with God. ☁️⬆️🙏
## 2 Corinthians 12:3
Paul says, I do not know if he was in his body or not. God knows. 🤷‍♂️✨
## 2 Corinthians 12:4
He went to God’s home. He heard words too good to say. 🌿🏠👂
## 2 Corinthians 12:5
I can brag about that man. But I will not brag about me. I will tell about my weak self. 🙅‍♂️💬
## 2 Corinthians 12:6
If I brag, I will say what is true. But I will not. I want you to see me by what I do and say. 👀✅
## 2 Corinthians 12:7
God let me have a hard hurt, like a thorn. It keeps me weak, so I do not get proud. 🌵😣
## 2 Corinthians 12:8
I asked the Lord 3 times to take it away. 🙏3️⃣
## 2 Corinthians 12:9
<jesus>My help is enough for you. My power works best when you are weak.</jesus> So I am glad to talk about my weak self. Then His power can rest on me. ✝️💪😊
## 2 Corinthians 12:10
So I am glad in weak and hard times, for Jesus. When I am weak, then I am strong with Him. 😊💔➡️💪
## 2 Corinthians 12:11
I talked like a fool, but you made me. You should say good of me. I am not less than the big leaders, even if I am like nothing. 🗣️😔
## 2 Corinthians 12:12
God used me to do true signs. God did wonders and big works with me. ✨🙌
## 2 Corinthians 12:13
You were not less than other groups. I did not make you pay me. Please forgive me for this. 🤝
## 2 Corinthians 12:14
I will come to you again, a third time. I will not take your money. I want you, not your things. Parents save for kids, not kids for parents. 🧳3️⃣❤️👨‍👩‍👧‍👦
## 2 Corinthians 12:15
I will give all I have for you. I will give myself too. I love you more and more. Will you love me less? 💝🫶
## 2 Corinthians 12:16
Some say, “Paul did not take money, but he tricked us!” They say I used a trick. 🕵️‍♂️
## 2 Corinthians 12:17
Did I use any worker I sent to you to take from you? ❓
## 2 Corinthians 12:18
I asked Titus to go. He went with a brother. He did not take from you. We walked the same good way. 🚶‍♂️🚶‍♂️👍
## 2 Corinthians 12:19
Do you think I talk just to make me look good? No. We talk before God with Jesus. We talk to help you grow strong in Jesus. 🙏⬆️
## 2 Corinthians 12:20
I fear I may find you not how I want. I may see fights, mad hearts, mean words, bad talk, proud ways, and a big mess. 😟⚠️
## 2 Corinthians 12:21
I fear God may make me sad when I come. I may cry for many who did bad and did not stop. Please say sorry and stop the bad. 😢🙏⛔
