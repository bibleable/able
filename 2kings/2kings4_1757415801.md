## 2 Kings 4:1
A sad widow said to Elisha, “My man is dead. He loved God. A man wants my two boys to work for him for my money I owe.” 😢👩‍👦👦
## 2 Kings 4:2
Elisha said, “What can I do? What do you have?” She said, “I have only one small jar of oil.” 🫙
## 2 Kings 4:3
Elisha said, “Go. Ask all neighbors for many empty jars. Get many.” 🫙🫙🫙
## 2 Kings 4:4
“Go home. Shut the door. Pour oil into each jar. When one is full, put it aside.” 🚪➡️🫙🫙
## 2 Kings 4:5
She did it. Her sons brought jars. She poured oil. 🫙➡️🫙
## 2 Kings 4:6
She said, “Bring one more jar.” He said, “No more.” Then the oil stopped. 🛑🫙
## 2 Kings 4:7
She told Elisha. He said, “Sell the oil. Pay what you owe. You and your boys can live on the rest.” 😊💰
## 2 Kings 4:8
Elisha went to a town. A kind woman gave him food. He ate there many times. 🍞🙂
## 2 Kings 4:9
She told her man, “That man is a holy man of God. He comes here a lot.” 🙏
## 2 Kings 4:10
“Let us make a small room for him. Put a bed, a table, a chair, and a lamp. He can rest here.” 🛏️🪑💡
## 2 Kings 4:11
One day Elisha came, went to the room, and lay down. 🛏️
## 2 Kings 4:12
Elisha said to his helper, Gehazi, “Call the woman.” She came and stood by. 🧍‍♀️
## 2 Kings 4:13
Elisha said, “You are so kind. What can we do for you? Talk to the king?” She said, “No, I am fine with my people.” 🙂
## 2 Kings 4:14
Elisha said, “What can we do?” Gehazi said, “She has no son. Her man is old.” 👶
## 2 Kings 4:15
Elisha said, “Call her.” She came and stood in the door. 🚪
## 2 Kings 4:16
Elisha said, “Next year, you will hold a son.” She said, “Please, do not lie to me.” 👶❤️
## 2 Kings 4:17
The woman had a baby boy next year, just like Elisha said. 👶🎉
## 2 Kings 4:18
The boy grew. One day he went to his dad and the men cutting grain. 🌾
## 2 Kings 4:19
The boy said, “My head! My head!” The dad said to a helper, “Take him to his mom.” 🤕
## 2 Kings 4:20
The helper took him to his mom. He sat on her knees till noon. Then he died. 😭
## 2 Kings 4:21
She took him to Elisha’s bed, put him there, shut the door, and left. 🚪🛏️
## 2 Kings 4:22
She said to her man, “Please send a helper and a donkey. I will go to the man of God and come back.” 🫏
## 2 Kings 4:23
He said, “Why today? It is not a special day.” She said, “It will be okay.” 🙏
## 2 Kings 4:24
She got the donkey ready and said, “Go fast. Do not stop unless I say.” 🫏💨
## 2 Kings 4:25
She went to Elisha at a hill. He saw her far away and said, “Look, the woman is coming.” ⛰️
## 2 Kings 4:26
He said, “Run to her. Ask, ‘Are you okay? Is your man okay? Is your child okay?’” She said, “I am okay.” 🏃‍♂️
## 2 Kings 4:27
She came to Elisha, held his feet. Gehazi tried to stop her. Elisha said, “Let her be. She is very sad.” 😢
## 2 Kings 4:28
She said, “Did I ask for a son? I said, ‘Do not lie to me.’” 😔
## 2 Kings 4:29
Elisha said to Gehazi, “Take my stick. Go fast. Do not stop to say hi. Put the stick on the boy’s face.” 🪄
## 2 Kings 4:30
The mom said, “I will not leave you.” So Elisha went with her. 🚶‍♂️👩
## 2 Kings 4:31
Gehazi went first, put the stick on the boy’s face. No sound. No wake. He went back and said, “The boy did not wake.” 😞
## 2 Kings 4:32
Elisha came to the house. The boy was dead on the bed. 🛏️
## 2 Kings 4:33
Elisha went in, shut the door, and prayed to God. 🙏
## 2 Kings 4:34
He lay on the boy, mouth to mouth, eyes to eyes, hands to hands. The boy’s skin got warm. 🤲
## 2 Kings 4:35
Elisha walked back and forth, then lay on the boy again. The boy sneezed seven times and opened his eyes. 😮‍💨👀
## 2 Kings 4:36
Elisha said, “Call the woman.” She came. He said, “Pick up your son.” 👩‍👦
## 2 Kings 4:37
She bowed to the ground, then picked up her boy and went out. 🙇‍♀️👦
## 2 Kings 4:38
Elisha went to another town. There was little food in the land. The God learners sat with him. He said, “Put on a big pot. Make soup for them.” 🍲
## 2 Kings 4:39
One man picked wild plants. He cut them into the pot. They did not know the plants. 🌿
## 2 Kings 4:40
They poured soup to eat. They cried, “Man of God, the soup is bad! We cannot eat!” 🤢
## 2 Kings 4:41
Elisha said, “Bring flour.” He put it in the pot. “Serve it.” The soup was safe. 🍞➡️🍲
## 2 Kings 4:42
A man came from far. He brought 20 loaves of bread and fresh grain to Elisha. Elisha said, “Give it to the people to eat.” 🍞🍞
## 2 Kings 4:43
His helper said, “How can this feed 100 men?” Elisha said, “Give it. God says, ‘They will eat and have some left.’” 🍽️
## 2 Kings 4:44
They gave it. They ate and had food left, just like God said. 😊🍞
