## Daniel 7:1
It was the first year of King Belshazzar in Babylon. Daniel had a night dream and wrote it down. ✍️😴
## Daniel 7:2
Daniel said, I saw the wind from the sky blow on a big sea at night. 💨🌊
## Daniel 7:3
Four big animals came out of the sea. Each one was different. 🐾🌊
## Daniel 7:4
The first looked like a lion with eagle wings. The wings came off. It stood like a man and got a man’s heart. 🦁🦅➡️🚶❤️
## Daniel 7:5
The second was like a bear. It raised one side. It had three ribs in its mouth. A voice said, get up and eat a lot. 🐻🦴🦴🦴🗣️
## Daniel 7:6
Then I saw a fast cat, a leopard. It had four wings and four heads. It was allowed to rule. 🐆🪽🪽🪽🪽
## Daniel 7:7
Then I saw a fourth animal. It was very scary and very strong. It had big iron teeth. It crushed and stomped. It was not like the others. It had ten horns. 🐉🦷🦷🔩🔟
## Daniel 7:8
I looked at the horns. A small horn came up. Three horns fell out. The small horn had eyes like a man and a mouth that spoke proud big words. 🦌👀🗣️
## Daniel 7:9
Many seats were set. God, very old and holy, sat down. His clothes were white like snow. His hair was like clean wool. His seat was like fire, with wheels like fire. 👑❄️🤍🔥🛞🔥
## Daniel 7:10
A river of fire came out. Many, many people served God. Many stood by Him. Court sat. The books were opened. 🔥🏞️👥👥📖
## Daniel 7:11
I kept looking because the small horn spoke proud big words. The big animal was killed. Its body was burned in the fire. 🗣️🔥❌
## Daniel 7:12
The other animals lost their rule. They were let live for a set time. ⏳
## Daniel 7:13
In my night dream, I saw Someone like a Son of Man come with the clouds. He came to God. They brought Him near. ☁️👤➡️🙏
## Daniel 7:14
He got to rule and have a land to rule. All people in all lands, with all ways to talk, served Him. His rule will last for all time. His land will not end. 🌍👑⏲️♾️
## Daniel 7:15
I, Daniel, felt sad and afraid inside. The dream troubled me. 😟😨
## Daniel 7:16
I went near one who stood there and asked, Please tell me what this means. He told me and helped me know. 🚶‍♂️❓🗣️
## Daniel 7:17
He said, The four big animals are four kings on earth. 4️⃣👑🌍
## Daniel 7:18
But God’s holy people will get the land to rule. They will have it for all time. 🙌👑♾️
## Daniel 7:19
Then I wanted to know more about the fourth animal. It was so scary, with iron teeth and metal claws. It crushed and stomped. 🐉🔩🦷🗡️
## Daniel 7:20
I asked about the ten horns on its head, and the other horn that came and made three fall. That horn had eyes and a mouth that spoke very big words. It looked bigger than the rest. 🦌👀🗣️⬆️
## Daniel 7:21
I saw that horn fight God’s people. It was winning for a time. ⚔️😢
## Daniel 7:22
Then God, very old and holy, came. God judged for God’s people. The time came, and God’s people got the land to rule. 👑⚖️🙌
## Daniel 7:23
He said, The fourth animal is the fourth land to rule on earth. It will be different. It will eat the whole earth. It will stomp and break it. 🌍🐉🦷👣
## Daniel 7:24
The ten horns are ten kings. Another king will rise after them. He will be different. He will take down three kings. 🔟👑➕1⬇️3
## Daniel 7:25
He will speak against God. He will hurt and tire God’s people. He will try to change times and rules. God’s people will be under him for a set time: one time, two times, and half a time. 🗣️😠⏳1️⃣2️⃣🌓
## Daniel 7:26
But the court will sit. They will take away his rule. He will be done for good. ⚖️❌
## Daniel 7:27
Then the rule and the lands under the sky will be given to God’s holy people. His rule will last forever. All rulers will serve and obey Him. 🌎👑♾️🙏
## Daniel 7:28
This is the end of the dream. I, Daniel, was very troubled. My face changed. But I kept the dream in my heart. 😟🤐
