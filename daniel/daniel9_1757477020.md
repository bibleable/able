## Daniel 9:1
It was year 1 of King Darius. He was from the Medes. He was king over the land. 🗓️👑🌍
## Daniel 9:2
I, Daniel, read God’s book by Jeremiah. It said the city would be empty 70 years. 📖⏳🏙️
## Daniel 9:3
I prayed to God. I did not eat. I wore rough, sad clothes and sat in ashes. 🙏😔🍽️❌🧣
## Daniel 9:4
I said, God, You are big and good. You keep Your promise to people who love You. We did wrong. 🙌❤️
## Daniel 9:5
We sinned. We did bad. We did not do what You said. 🙇‍♂️🚫
## Daniel 9:6
We did not listen to Your men, the prophets. They spoke to our kings and all the people. 🗣️🙉👑
## Daniel 9:7
God, You are right. We feel bad and look down, near and far, because we sinned. 😞🌍
## Daniel 9:8
God, we and our kings feel bad. We sinned against You. 😔👑
## Daniel 9:9
God is kind and He forgives. But we turned away. ❤️🙏↩️❌
## Daniel 9:10
We did not obey Your voice. We did not walk by Your rules that the prophets gave. 🚫👂📜
## Daniel 9:11
All Israel broke Your rules. The words in the book of Moses came on us, because we sinned. 📖⚠️
## Daniel 9:12
You did what You said. You let big trouble come. No city had trouble like Your city. 🌩️🏙️
## Daniel 9:13
All this came like the book said. But we did not pray to turn from sin and learn Your way. 🙏❌🔄
## Daniel 9:14
So You watched and sent the trouble. You are right. We did not obey. 👀⚖️
## Daniel 9:15
Now, God, You brought Your people out of Egypt with a strong hand and made Your name big. We have sinned and done bad. 🖐️💪🚶‍♂️🇪🇬
## Daniel 9:16
Please, God, turn Your anger from Your city, Jerusalem, and Your special hill. Our sin made others make fun of Your city and people. 😢🙏🏙️⛰️
## Daniel 9:17
Now please hear us. Please smile on Your house that is empty, for Your name. 👂😊🏠
## Daniel 9:18
My God, please hear and see. Our city is broken. We ask not because we are good, but because You are very kind. 👀👂💔➡️❤️
## Daniel 9:19
God, hear. God, forgive. God, act now. Do not wait, for Your name. Your city and Your people have Your name. ⏰🙏✅
## Daniel 9:20
While I prayed and said sorry for my sin and my people’s sin, I asked for Your city and Your special hill. 🙏😢🏙️⛰️
## Daniel 9:21
While I prayed, the angel Gabriel came fast to me at evening time. He touched me. 👼⚡🌅✋
## Daniel 9:22
He taught me and said, Daniel, I came to help you understand. 🧠👨‍🏫
## Daniel 9:23
When you began to pray, a word came. I came to show you, for you are very loved. So listen and think about the dream. 💬💖🧠
## Daniel 9:24
God set 70 weeks for your people and your special city: to end sin, to stop wrong, to make sins gone, to bring good that lasts, to finish the dream, and to ready the most special. 7️⃣0️⃣🗓️✅✨
## Daniel 9:25
Know this: from the word to build Jerusalem to the special king, there will be 7 weeks and 62 weeks. The city and wall will be built again in hard days. 🏗️🏙️🧱⛈️
## Daniel 9:26
After the 62 weeks, the special one will die. A people of a leader to come will break the city and the house of God. The end will come fast, and war will go on; the place will be empty. ⚔️🏙️💥🌊
## Daniel 9:27
He will make a strong promise with many for one week. In the middle of the week he will stop gifts to God. A very bad thing will make the place empty, until the end comes. 📜1️⃣🛑🎁🚫
