## Daniel 5:1
King Belshazzar made a big party for 1,000 big men. He drank wine. 🎉🍷
## Daniel 5:2
While he drank, the king said, “Bring the gold and silver cups from God’s house in the city.” He wanted to drink with his big men and wives. 🍷🥇🥈
## Daniel 5:3
They brought the gold cups from God’s house. The king, his big men, and his wives drank. 🏛️🥇🍷
## Daniel 5:4
They said good things to fake gods made of gold, silver, bronze, iron, wood, and stone. 🗿✨
## Daniel 5:5
Right then, a hand came. It wrote on the wall by a light. ✋📝🧱🕯️
## Daniel 5:6
The king’s face changed. His legs shook. His knees hit. 😨🦵🫨
## Daniel 5:7
The king yelled, “Bring the wise men!” He said, “Read the words, and I will give purple clothes, a gold chain, and make you number 3 boss.” 📣🧠👑
## Daniel 5:8
All the wise men came. They could not read the wall. They could not tell the king. ❌📝
## Daniel 5:9
The king got more scared. The big men did not know what to do. 😟🤷
## Daniel 5:10
The queen heard and came. She said, “O king, do not be scared. There is a man who can help.” 👑👸
## Daniel 5:11
Long ago, King Nebuchadnezzar made Daniel leader of the wise. Daniel was very wise. God helped him. 🧠🙏
## Daniel 5:12
Daniel can tell dreams and hard things. Call Daniel. He will tell you. ☎️
## Daniel 5:13
Daniel came to the king. The king said, “Are you Daniel?” 🤴➡️👨
## Daniel 5:14
The king said, “I hear God helps you. You are wise and can understand.” 🗣️✨
## Daniel 5:15
The king said, “My wise men cannot read the wall. But I hear you can.” 🧱❓
## Daniel 5:16
The king said, “If you read it, I will give purple, a gold chain, and make you number 3 boss.” 🎁👑
## Daniel 5:17
Daniel said, “Keep your gifts. I will read the words for you, O king.” ✋🎁📖
## Daniel 5:18
Daniel said, “God over all made King Nebuchadnezzar very great.” ☝️👑
## Daniel 5:19
All people were afraid of him. He could keep people alive or not. He could lift people up or make them low. 😨⬆️⬇️
## Daniel 5:20
But he got proud. Then God took his power. 😠➡️❌
## Daniel 5:21
He was sent away from people. He lived like an animal. He ate grass. His hair and nails grew long. Then he knew God rules all kings. 🌿🐂
## Daniel 5:22
Daniel said, “You, King Belshazzar, knew this. But you did not make your heart low.” 📣💔
## Daniel 5:23
You took God’s cups. You and your people drank from them. You said good things to fake gods. But you did not say God is great. God holds your life. 🏛️🥤🗿✋
## Daniel 5:24
So God sent the hand to write these words. ✋➡️📝
## Daniel 5:25
The words say: MENE, MENE, TEKEL, PARSIN. 🔤
## Daniel 5:26
MENE means: God counted your days as king. He will end it. ⏱️🏁
## Daniel 5:27
TEKEL means: God weighed you. You are not good enough. ⚖️❌
## Daniel 5:28
PERES means: Your kingdom will be split. It will go to the Medes and the Persians. ✂️➡️🛡️
## Daniel 5:29
Then the king put purple on Daniel, gave him a gold chain, and made him number 3 boss. 🟣📿3️⃣
## Daniel 5:30
That night the king Belshazzar was killed. 🌙⚔️
## Daniel 5:31
Darius the Mede got the kingdom. He became the new king. 👑
