## Daniel 4:1
King Nebuchadnezzar wrote to all people. He said, “Peace to you.” 👑✉️🌍✌️
## Daniel 4:2
The king wanted to tell what God did for him. 🙏🗣️
## Daniel 4:3
God is big and strong. God is king for all time. 👑✨⏳
## Daniel 4:4
The king lived easy in his big house. He felt safe. 🏰😌
## Daniel 4:5
The king had a dream. The dream made him scared. 😴😱
## Daniel 4:6
He called smart men to tell the dream’s meaning. 📣👨‍🦳🔍
## Daniel 4:7
The smart men came. They could not tell the meaning. 🚶‍♂️🚶‍♂️🤷
## Daniel 4:8
Then Daniel came. His other name was Belteshazzar. God’s Holy Spirit was in him. The king told him the dream. 🙇‍♂️✨
## Daniel 4:9
The king said Daniel was chief and could tell the meaning. He asked Daniel to tell it. 🗣️🤝
## Daniel 4:10
In the dream the king saw a big tree in the middle of the land. 🌳👀
## Daniel 4:11
The tree grew very, very tall. All could see it. 🌳⬆️🌍
## Daniel 4:12
The tree had many leaves and much fruit. Animals rested under it. Birds sat in it. All had food. 🌳🍎🐄🕊️
## Daniel 4:13
Then an angel came down from the sky. 👼⬇️☁️
## Daniel 4:14
The angel said, “Cut the tree. Cut the branches. Shake off the leaves. Make the animals run.” ✂️🌳🐄🏃‍♂️
## Daniel 4:15
“Leave the stump and roots with a metal ring of iron and bronze. Let the man be wet with dew. Let him live with animals and eat grass.” 🌱🪵💧🐄
## Daniel 4:16
“His mind will be like an animal. This will last seven years.” 🤯➡️🐂⏳7
## Daniel 4:17
“This is from God. God is boss of all people. God can make a low man the ruler.” ☁️➡️🌍👑
## Daniel 4:18
The king said, “This is my dream. Tell me what it means, Daniel. Others could not.” 🗣️😕
## Daniel 4:19
Daniel sat quiet and afraid for a time. The king said, “Do not fear.” Daniel said he wished the dream was for bad men. 😟🤐➡️💬
## Daniel 4:20
Daniel said, “The big tree is you, O king.” 👑🌳
## Daniel 4:21
“You grew big and strong. All could see you.” 💪⬆️🌍
## Daniel 4:22
“You give food and help to many. You rule a wide land.” 🍞🤲🌍
## Daniel 4:23
“The angel said, ‘Cut the tree, but leave the stump with a metal ring. The man will live outside and be wet with dew. He will live with animals. Seven years will pass.’” 👼✂️🪵💧🐄⏳7
## Daniel 4:24
“This is what it means: God says this will happen to you, O king.” ☝️📜
## Daniel 4:25
“You will be sent away from people. You will live like an animal. You will eat grass. You will get wet with dew. Seven years will pass. Then you will know God rules over all and gives power to who He wants.” 🌾🐄💧⏳7➡️☝️👑
## Daniel 4:26
“The stump means your rule will come back when you say God rules.” 🪵🔁☝️
## Daniel 4:27
“Please do right. Stop doing wrong. Be kind to the poor. Maybe God will not punish you.” 🙏✅💗🤝
## Daniel 4:28
All this came true for the king. ✅📖
## Daniel 4:29
One year later, the king walked on his big house in Babylon. 🏰🚶‍♂️
## Daniel 4:30
The king said, “I did this. I am great.” 🗣️😤🏰
## Daniel 4:31
A voice from the sky said, “King, your power is gone now.” ☁️🔊❌👑
## Daniel 4:32
“You will live like an animal. You will be out with the cows. This will last seven years, until you know God rules all.” 🐄🌾⏳7☝️
## Daniel 4:33
It happened at once. The king went out. He ate grass. He got wet with dew. His hair grew long like feathers. His nails grew long like claws. 🌧️🌾🧔‍♂️🪶🧌🗡️
## Daniel 4:34
After the time, the king looked up to the sky. His mind came back. He thanked God and said God lives for ever. 🙏☁️🧠🔙
## Daniel 4:35
God does what He wants in sky and on earth. No one can stop Him. We are small next to God. ☁️🌍✋❌
## Daniel 4:36
The king got his mind back. His men came back. His power came back. His rule became even bigger. 🧠✅🤝👑⬆️
## Daniel 4:37
The king said, “I thank God, the King of the sky. What God does is right. God can bring down people who are proud.” 🙌☁️👑⬇️
