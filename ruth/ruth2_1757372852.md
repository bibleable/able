## Ruth 2:1
Naomi had a rich family man. His name was Boaz. He was from her husband’s big family. 🧔💰🌾
## Ruth 2:2
Ruth said to Naomi, “I will go pick little grain in a field. Maybe someone will be kind.” Naomi said, “Go, my girl.” 🚶‍♀️🌾
## Ruth 2:3
Ruth went to a field. She picked little grain. It was Boaz’s field. She did not know. 🌾🧺
## Ruth 2:4
Boaz came from the town and said to the workers, “God bless you.” The workers said, “God bless you.” 🧔🙏😊
## Ruth 2:5
Boaz asked the boss, “Who is that young woman?” 🧔👉👩
## Ruth 2:6
The boss said, “She is Ruth. She came from a far land with Naomi.” 👩‍🌾➡️🏠
## Ruth 2:7
The boss said, “Ruth asked to pick little grain. She worked all morning. She sat for a short rest.” 🌅💪🧺⏸️
## Ruth 2:8
Boaz said to Ruth, “Listen, my girl. Stay in my field. Stay with my girls.” 🧔🗣️👩‍🌾👭🌾
## Ruth 2:9
Boaz said, “Watch my field. Follow my girls. I told the men, ‘Do not hurt her.’ When you are thirsty, drink the water from my jars.” 🧔🛡️🚫💧
## Ruth 2:10
Ruth bowed down and said, “Why are you so kind to me? I am from far away.” 🙇‍♀️❤️
## Ruth 2:11
Boaz said, “I heard what you did. You helped Naomi. You left your mom, dad, and land. You came here.” 🧔👂🤝🏠
## Ruth 2:12
Boaz said, “May God pay you back for your good work. The God of Israel will cover you like big wings. Stay near Him.” 🙏🪽
## Ruth 2:13
Ruth said, “You are so kind to me. Your words make me feel good. I am not even your worker.” 😊🗣️
## Ruth 2:14
At lunch Boaz said, “Come eat.” Ruth ate bread and grain. She was full. She saved some food. 🍞🌾😋
## Ruth 2:15
Ruth went to pick more. Boaz told the men, “Let her pick even near the big piles. Do not stop her.” 🧺🌾➡️
## Ruth 2:16
Boaz said, “Pull out some grain on purpose. Leave it for her. Do not be mean.” 🌾⬇️🧺😊
## Ruth 2:17
Ruth worked till night. She got a big bag of barley. 🌙💪🧺🌾
## Ruth 2:18
Ruth carried it home to Naomi. Naomi saw the grain. Ruth gave Naomi the saved food too. 🏠👩‍🦳🧺🍞
## Ruth 2:19
Naomi said, “Where did you work? God bless the man who was kind!” Ruth said, “His name is Boaz.” ❓🌾🙏🧔
## Ruth 2:20
Naomi said, “God is kind to the living and to our men who died. Boaz is our close family. He can help us.” 🙏❤️👨‍👩‍👧
## Ruth 2:21
Ruth said, “Boaz also said, ‘Stay with my workers till the end of all the harvest.’” 👩‍🌾👥🌾
## Ruth 2:22
Naomi said, “That is good, my girl. Stay with his girls. You will be safe in his field.” 👩‍🦳👍🛡️
## Ruth 2:23
So Ruth stayed with Boaz’s girls. She worked through barley time and wheat time. She lived with Naomi. 🌾➡️🌾🏠
