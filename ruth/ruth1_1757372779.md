## Ruth 1:1
Long ago, there was no food in the land. A man from Bethlehem, in Judah, left with his wife and two sons. They went to Moab. 🌾❌🍞🚶‍♂️👩‍👦‍👦➡️🏜️
## Ruth 1:2
The man was Elimelech. His wife was Naomi. The sons were Mahlon and Chilion. They stayed in Moab. 🧑‍🦳👩‍🦳👦👦🏠
## Ruth 1:3
Elimelech died. Naomi still had her two sons. 😢🕊️
## Ruth 1:4
The sons married women from Moab. One was Orpah. One was Ruth. They lived there 10 years. 💍💍🧕🧕⏳
## Ruth 1:5
Then both sons died. Naomi had no husband and no sons. 😭🕊️🕊️
## Ruth 1:6
Naomi heard God gave food to His people. She got up to go back home from Moab. The wives of her sons went with her. 🍞🙏🚶‍♀️🚶‍♀️🚶‍♀️
## Ruth 1:7
They left that place. They walked on the road to Judah. 🛣️🚶‍♀️🚶‍♀️🚶‍♀️
## Ruth 1:8
Naomi said to the two young women, “Go back. Go to your mom’s house. I ask God to be kind to you. You were kind to my sons and to me.” 🗣️🏠❤️
## Ruth 1:9
Naomi said, “I ask God to give you rest. I ask God to give you new homes.” She kissed them, and they cried loud. 😘😭
## Ruth 1:10
The two women said, “We will go with you. We will go to your people.” 🚶‍♀️🚶‍♀️🤝
## Ruth 1:11
Naomi said, “Turn back, my girls. Why go with me? I have no more sons for you to marry.” ↩️💬
## Ruth 1:12
Naomi said, “Turn back. I am too old to marry again. Even if I had a baby now, you could not wait.” 🔄👵
## Ruth 1:13
Naomi said, “Would you wait till boys grow up? No. Do not wait. I am very, very sad. I feel God is not with me.” 😔
## Ruth 1:14
They cried again. Orpah kissed Naomi and went back. But Ruth held on to Naomi. 😭💔🤝
## Ruth 1:15
Naomi said, “Look, Orpah went back to her people and her old gods. You go back too.” 👀↩️
## Ruth 1:16
But Ruth said, “Do not make me go. Where you go, I will go. Where you stay, I will stay. Your people are my people. Your God is my God.” 👣🏠🤝🙏
## Ruth 1:17
Ruth said, “Where you die, I will die. I will be put in the ground there. Only death will part us. God, hear me.” ⚰️🤍
## Ruth 1:18
Naomi saw Ruth would not stop. So Naomi did not talk about it more. 👀🤫
## Ruth 1:19
They walked till they came to Bethlehem. The town talked a lot. The women said, “Is this Naomi?” 🚶‍♀️🚶‍♀️🏘️❓
## Ruth 1:20
Naomi said, “Do not call me Naomi. Call me Mara. God has made me very sad.” 😢
## Ruth 1:21
Naomi said, “I left with much. God brought me back with no husband and no sons. Do not call me Naomi. God has made my life hard.” 👐➡️🫙❌👨‍🦳❌👦❌👦
## Ruth 1:22
So Naomi came back. Ruth, the woman from Moab, came with her. They came to Bethlehem at the start of barley harvest. 🚶‍♀️🚶‍♀️🌾
