## Ruth 1:1
In old days, there was no food. A man from Bethlehem in Judah went to Moab with his wife and two boys. 🚶‍♂️➡️🌍🍞❌
## Ruth 1:2
The man was Elimelech. His wife was Naomi. The boys were Mahlon and Chilion. They were from Bethlehem in Judah. They lived in Moab. 🧑‍🧑‍🧒‍🧒🏠
## Ruth 1:3
Elimelech died. Naomi stayed with her two boys. 😢
## Ruth 1:4
The boys married women from Moab. One was Orpah. One was Ruth. They lived there ten years. 💍💍🕰️
## Ruth 1:5
The two boys died too. Naomi had no husband and no sons. 😭
## Ruth 1:6
Naomi heard God gave food in her home land. She got up to go back. Ruth and Orpah went with her. 🍞🙏🚶‍♀️🚶‍♀️
## Ruth 1:7
They left Moab. They started the trip to Judah. 🛣️
## Ruth 1:8
Naomi said to Ruth and Orpah, “Go home to your moms. May God be kind to you, like you were kind to me and to my sons.” 🗣️❤️🙏
## Ruth 1:9
Naomi said, “May God give you new homes and good husbands.” She kissed them. They cried loud. 😭💋
## Ruth 1:10
Ruth and Orpah said, “No. We will go with you to your people.” 🗣️🤝
## Ruth 1:11
Naomi said, “Please go back, my girls. I have no more sons for you.” 🗣️🙁
## Ruth 1:12
Naomi said, “Go back. I am too old to marry again. Even if I had babies now…” 🗣️🧓
## Ruth 1:13
Naomi said, “Would you wait many years? No. I feel very hurt. God let hard things happen to me.” 🗣️💔
## Ruth 1:14
They cried again. Orpah kissed Naomi and went back. Ruth held on to Naomi. 😭🤗
## Ruth 1:15
Naomi said, “See, Orpah went back to her people and her gods. You go back too.” 🗣️👋
## Ruth 1:16
Ruth said, “Do not make me leave you. Where you go, I will go. Where you stay, I will stay. Your people are my people. Your God is my God.” 🗣️🤝🙏
## Ruth 1:17
Ruth said, “Where you die, I will die. I will be put in the ground there. May God punish me if I leave you. Only death will keep us apart.” 🗣️⚰️🤞
## Ruth 1:18
Naomi saw Ruth would not change. Naomi stopped talking about it. 👀🤫
## Ruth 1:19
They walked to Bethlehem. The town talked and looked. The women said, “Is this Naomi?” 🚶‍♀️🚶‍♀️🏘️
## Ruth 1:20
Naomi said, “Do not call me Naomi. Call me Mara. God has made my life very hard.” 🗣️😔
## Ruth 1:21
Naomi said, “I left with much. God brought me back with little. Do not call me Naomi. God let bad things happen to me.” 🗣️🌧️
## Ruth 1:22
So Naomi came home. Ruth from Moab came with her. They reached Bethlehem at barley time. 🏠🤝🌾
