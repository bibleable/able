Do not be tricked. No one can make fun of God. What you plant is what you get. 🌱➡️🌾

## Galatians 6:11
Look! I, Paul, write this part with big letters. ✍️🔠
## Galatians 6:12
Some people want to look good to others. They push you to do a body rule so they will not get hurt for Jesus on the cross. 😕👉✂️➡️😣✝️
## Galatians 6:13
Those same people do not keep all the rules. They still want you to do that body rule so they can brag. 🚫📏😬
## Galatians 6:14
I, Paul, will not brag. I only brag about Jesus on the cross. Because of Jesus, the bad world is like dead to me, and I am like dead to that bad world. ✝️❤️
## Galatians 6:15
That body rule or no body rule does not make you good. What matters is a new you from God. 🌟🆕
## Galatians 6:16
May God give peace and kind help to all who live this way, and to God’s people. 🕊️🤍
## Galatians 6:17
From now on, do not give me trouble. I have marks on my body for Jesus. ✝️💪
## Galatians 6:18
May our Lord Jesus be kind to you inside. Amen. 🙏❤️
