## Galatians 1:1
Paul says, I am Paul. Jesus sent me. People did not send me. God the Father made Him live again. ✍️✝️✨
## Galatians 1:2
My friends are with me. We write to the church groups in Galatia. 👋📝
## Galatians 1:3
I ask God our Father and the Lord Jesus to be kind to you and give you peace. 🙏🕊️
## Galatians 1:4
Jesus gave His life to take away our wrong. He saved us from bad in this world. This was what God wanted. ✝️❤️🌍
## Galatians 1:5
We say, Yay God, for always! 🌟🙌
## Galatians 1:6
I am surprised. You turn from God, who called you to Jesus. You go to a different good news. 😮➡️
## Galatians 1:7
There is no other good news. Some people make you mixed up. They change the good news about Jesus. 🚫🔀
## Galatians 1:8
If we, or even an angel, say a new good news, do not listen. That is very bad. 🚫👂
## Galatians 1:9
I say it again: if anyone tells a new good news, do not listen. That is very bad. 🔁🚫
## Galatians 1:10
Do I try to make people happy, or God? I want to make God happy. If I just make people happy, I am not Jesus’ helper. ❤️‍🔥🙅‍♂️
## Galatians 1:11
Family, hear me: the good news I tell you is not from people. 🗣️📖
## Galatians 1:12
No one taught me this. Jesus showed me. ✝️👀
## Galatians 1:13
You heard about me before. I hurt God’s church. I tried to stop it. 😔💔
## Galatians 1:14
I did very well in my old way. I loved old rules more than many my age. 🧠🏃‍♂️
## Galatians 1:15
But God chose me before I was born. He was kind and called me. 👶✨
## Galatians 1:16
God showed His Son to me. I should tell people in all places about Him. I did not ask people first. 🌍🗣️
## Galatians 1:17
I did not go to Jerusalem then. I went to Arabia. Then I went back to Damascus. 🧭🚶‍♂️
## Galatians 1:18
After 3 years, I went to Jerusalem. I met Peter and stayed 15 days. ⏳🤝
## Galatians 1:19
I did not see the other helpers. I only saw James, Jesus’ brother. 👋
## Galatians 1:20
I tell the truth. God knows I do not lie. ✋🙏
## Galatians 1:21
Then I went to Syria and Cilicia. 🗺️
## Galatians 1:22
The churches in Judea did not know me by face yet. 🚶‍♂️👀
## Galatians 1:23
They only heard, “The man who hurt us now tells the faith he tried to stop.” 🔁✨
## Galatians 1:24
They praised God because of me. 🙌❤️
