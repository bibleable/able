## Galatians 3:1
Paul said to all of you in Galatia: You are not thinking well. Who tricked you? You saw Jesus on the cross. ✝️🤔
## Galatians 3:2
Paul said: Did you get God's Holy Spirit by doing rules? Or by hearing and trusting? 👂❤️🕊️
## Galatians 3:3
You started with God's Holy Spirit. Will you try to finish by your own self now? 🕊️➡️💪
## Galatians 3:4
Did you have hard times for Jesus for nothing? 😞✝️
## Galatians 3:5
God gives God's Holy Spirit and does big works. Did He do this from rules? Or from hearing and trusting? 🕊️✨👂❤️
## Galatians 3:6
Abraham trusted God. God said, That is good. 👍🙏
## Galatians 3:7
So, people who trust are like kids of Abraham. 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦❤️
## Galatians 3:8
The Bible said long ago: God will call people who are not Jews good by trust. God told Abraham, “All groups will get good from you.” 📖🌍🙂
## Galatians 3:9
So all who trust get good with Abraham, who trusted. 😊🤝
## Galatians 3:10
If you try to be right by rules, it is a bad thing. The Bible says, “Bad for all who do not do all the rules all the time.” ⚠️📖
## Galatians 3:11
No one is made right with God by rules. The Bible says, “The good person lives by trust.” 📖❤️
## Galatians 3:12
The rules are not trust. The rules say, “Do the rules to live.” 📜➡️👣
## Galatians 3:13
Jesus took the bad for us. He died on the cross tree for us. Now we are free. ✝️🕊️
## Galatians 3:14
This was so all people can get the good like Abraham, in Christ Jesus. We get God's Holy Spirit by trust. 🌍😊🕊️
## Galatians 3:15
Paul said: Think of a deal people make. When it is set, people do not change it. 🤝✍️
## Galatians 3:16
God made a promise to Abraham and to one child. It did not say many kids. The one child is Christ. 👶➡️Christ
## Galatians 3:17
The rules came 430 years later. The rules did not stop God's promise. 430 ⏳➡️📜❌
## Galatians 3:18
If the gift came by rules, it is not by promise. But God gave it to Abraham by a promise. 🎁➡️📜
## Galatians 3:19
Why the rules? The rules showed wrong. The rules were for a time, until the one child came. Angels used a helper to give the rules. ⛔⏳👼🤝
## Galatians 3:20
A helper stands between two. But God is one. 1️⃣
## Galatians 3:21
Are the rules against God's promise? No. If rules could give life, rules would make us right. ❓➡️❌📜
## Galatians 3:22
The Bible says we all do wrong. So the promise comes by trust in Jesus Christ to all who trust. 📖➡️❌… then ❤️ in Christ
## Galatians 3:23
Before trust came, the rules held us, like in a hold, until trust came. ⛓️⏳➡️❤️
## Galatians 3:24
The rules were like a teacher guard until Christ came. Then we are made right by trust. 🛡️👩‍🏫➡️Christ❤️
## Galatians 3:25
Now trust is here. We are not under the guard now. ❤️🕊️
## Galatians 3:26
In Christ Jesus, all of you are God's kids by trust. 👑👶❤️
## Galatians 3:27
All of you who were put in water into Christ put on Christ, like new clothes. 💧➡️Christ👕
## Galatians 3:28
In Christ Jesus, all of you are one. It does not matter if you are Jew or not, slave or free, boy or girl. We are one in Him. 🤝❤️
## Galatians 3:29
If you belong to Christ, you are like kids of Abraham. You get the gift God promised. 🎁👨‍👩‍👧‍👦
