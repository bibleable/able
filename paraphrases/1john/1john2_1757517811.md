## 1 John 2:1
Dear kids, I write to help you not do wrong. But if you do wrong, Jesus helps us with the Father. He always does what is right. 📝👶✝️🙏
## 1 John 2:2
Jesus took the bad for our wrong. He did this for the whole world. ✝️🌍
## 1 John 2:3
We know we know Him when we keep His rules. ✅📖
## 1 John 2:4
If a person says, “I know Him,” but does not keep His rules, that person tells a lie, and the truth is not in him. 🚫🤥
## 1 John 2:5
If a person keeps His word, God’s love is big in that one. Then we know we live in Him. ❤️🏠
## 1 John 2:6
If we say we stay with Him, we must live like Jesus lived. 👣
## 1 John 2:7
Dear ones, this is not a new rule, but an old rule you heard from the start. 🕰️👂
## 1 John 2:8
It is also new now. The dark is going away, and the true light is shining. 🌑➡️🌞
## 1 John 2:9
If someone says, “I am in the light,” but hates his brother, he is still in the dark. 💡❌➡️🌑
## 1 John 2:10
Whoever loves his brother stays in the light, and he will not make others trip. 💡❤️🚶‍♂️
## 1 John 2:11
Whoever hates his brother is in the dark, walks in the dark, and cannot see where to go, because the dark made his eyes blind. 🌑🚶‍♂️🕶️
## 1 John 2:12
Little kids, I write to you, because God forgave your wrongs because of Jesus. 🧒📝🙏
## 1 John 2:13
I write to dads: you know God from the start. I write to young men: you beat the bad one. I write to kids: you know the Father. 👨‍👧‍👦💪👦
## 1 John 2:14
I write to dads: you know God from the start. I write to young men: you are strong, God’s word lives in you, and you beat the bad one. 📖💪
## 1 John 2:15
Do not love this world or its stuff. If you love the world, God’s love is not in you. 🌍❌🧡
## 1 John 2:16
In this world are bad wants of the body, bad wants of the eyes, and the “I am best” feeling; these are not from the Father but from the world. 👀🍰😤
## 1 John 2:17
The world and its bad wants will end, but whoever does what God wants lives with God forever. ⏳➡️♾️🙏
## 1 John 2:18
Kids, it is the last time. You heard a fake teacher against Jesus will come; now many fake ones are here, so we know it is the last time. ⏰⚠️
## 1 John 2:19
They left us. They were not really with us. If they were with us, they would stay. They left to show they were not with us. 🚪👋
## 1 John 2:20
But all of you have a gift from God. God’s Holy Spirit helps you know what is true. 🎁🕊️
## 1 John 2:21
I write to you because you know the truth, and no lie comes from the truth. ✍️✅
## 1 John 2:22
Who is the liar? It is the one who says, “Jesus is not the One God picked.” This one is against Jesus and says “No” to the Father and the Son. ❌✝️
## 1 John 2:23
Whoever says “No” to the Son does not have the Father. Whoever says “Yes” to the Son has the Father too. ✝️👍
## 1 John 2:24
Keep the true word you heard from the start in you. If you keep it, you will stay with the Son and the Father. 🧠💖
## 1 John 2:25
God made a promise to us: life that never ends. 🎁♾️
## 1 John 2:26
I write this about people who try to trick you. 🎭⚠️
## 1 John 2:27
God’s Holy Spirit stays in you and teaches you all you need. He is true, not a lie. So stay with Him. 🕊️📖
## 1 John 2:28
Now, dear kids, stay with Him. When He comes, we will feel brave and will not hide in shame. 🧒💪😊
## 1 John 2:29
You know He is right and good. So you know all who do right are His children. 🤝👨‍👩‍👧‍👦
