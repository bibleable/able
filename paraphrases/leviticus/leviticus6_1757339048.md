## Leviticus 6:1
God spoke to Moses. 📣
## Leviticus 6:2
God said, If someone lies or takes what is not his from a friend, that is wrong to God. 🚫👥
## Leviticus 6:3
If someone finds a lost thing and says a lie, “It is mine,” that is wrong. 🔍📦❌
## Leviticus 6:4
When the person sees he did wrong, he must give back what he took or found. ↩️👜
## Leviticus 6:5
He must pay it all back and add more, 1/5 more, that same day. ➕💰
## Leviticus 6:6
He must bring a male sheep with no bad spot to God’s helper as a pay-for-wrong gift. 🐏🙏
## Leviticus 6:7
God’s helper will pray to God for him, and God will forgive him. 🙏✅
## Leviticus 6:8
God spoke to Moses again. 📣
## Leviticus 6:9
Tell Aaron and his sons: Keep the burn gift on God’s fire table all night. Keep the fire on. 🔥🌙
## Leviticus 6:10
The helper puts on clean clothes, picks up the gray ash, and sets it by the fire table. 👕🧺🪣
## Leviticus 6:11
Then he changes clothes and takes the ash outside the camp to a clean place. 🚶‍♂️🗑️
## Leviticus 6:12
Keep the fire on; do not let it stop. Put wood on each morning. Put on the burn gift and the fat from the peace gift. 🔥🪵🍖
## Leviticus 6:13
Keep the fire on all the time. Do not let it stop. ♨️⏰
## Leviticus 6:14
This is the rule for the grain gift: Aaron’s sons bring it to God at the front of the fire table. 🌾🎁
## Leviticus 6:15
Take a hand of fine flour with oil and all the nice smell spice; burn it for God. ✋🌾🛢️🕯️
## Leviticus 6:16
Aaron and his sons eat the rest. Do not use yeast. Eat it in the holy place, in the big tent yard. 🍞🚫⛺
## Leviticus 6:17
Do not bake it with yeast. This food is a gift for them. It is very, very special, like the sin gift and the pay-for-wrong gift. 🍞❌✨
## Leviticus 6:18
Every man in Aaron’s family may eat it. It is very special. If you touch it, you must be clean. 👨‍👦‍👦🍽️
## Leviticus 6:19
God spoke to Moses again. 📣
## Leviticus 6:20
When oil is put on the leader to make him leader, he brings a grain gift that day: 1/10 of a big measure of fine flour, half in the morning and half at night. 🌅🌇🌾
## Leviticus 6:21
Mix it with oil and cook it on a pan. Bring it baked in pieces. The smell makes God glad. 🍳🥞
## Leviticus 6:22
The next helper, the new leader son, will bring it. Burn all of it for God. 🔥🙌
## Leviticus 6:23
If a helper brings a grain gift, burn all of it. Do not eat it. 🍞🔥🚫
## Leviticus 6:24
God spoke to Moses again. 📣
## Leviticus 6:25
Tell Aaron and his sons: The sin gift is killed at the same place as the burn gift, before God. It is very, very special. 🐑⚖️
## Leviticus 6:26
The helper who brings it for sin will eat it. Eat it in the holy place, in the big tent yard. 🍖⛺
## Leviticus 6:27
Whoever touches the meat must be clean. If the blood gets on clothes, wash the clothes in the holy place. 🩸🧺
## Leviticus 6:28
If you cook it in a clay pot, break the pot after. If in a metal pot, scrub it and wash it. 🍲🧽
## Leviticus 6:29
Every man helper may eat it. It is very, very special. 🍽️✨
## Leviticus 6:30
But if its blood is taken into the big tent to make people clean, no one may eat it. Burn it all with fire. 🔥⛺🚫
