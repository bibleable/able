## Leviticus 12:1
God talked to Moses. 🗣️👂
## Leviticus 12:2
God said: Tell the people of Israel, when a mom has a baby boy, she is not clean for 7 days, like her time of blood. 👶‍♂️7️⃣🩸
## Leviticus 12:3
On day 8, the baby boy gets a special cut. 8️⃣✂️👶‍♂️
## Leviticus 12:4
Then the mom waits 33 more days to be clean. She does not touch holy things. She does not go to God’s tent. ⏳3️⃣3️⃣✋✨⛺
## Leviticus 12:5
If the baby is a girl, the mom is not clean for 14 days. Then she waits 66 more days to be clean. 👶‍♀️1️⃣4️⃣⏳6️⃣6️⃣
## Leviticus 12:6
When the wait is done, the mom goes to God’s tent door. She brings a 1-year lamb for a fire gift. She brings a bird too, a dove or a pigeon, for a sorry gift. She gives them to the priest. 🚪⛺🐑🔥🐦🙏
## Leviticus 12:7
The priest burns the gifts for God. Then God says the mom is clean from her blood. This rule is for moms of boys or girls. 🔥➡️🙏✅
## Leviticus 12:8
If the mom is poor and cannot bring a lamb, she can bring two birds, two doves or two pigeons. The priest gives them to God. Then God says she is clean. 💰❌🐑➡️🐦🐦🙏✅
