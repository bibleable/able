## 2 Timothy 3:1
Paul said hard days will come in the last days. ⏰⛈️
## 2 Timothy 3:2
People will love self and love money. They will brag and be proud. They will say bad things of God. They will not obey mom and dad. They will not say thanks. They will not live good. 💔💰😠🙅‍♂️🙅‍♀️
## 2 Timothy 3:3
They will not love. They will not forgive. They will say mean words. They cannot stop doing bad. They will be mean and hurt. They will hate what is good. 😡🗣️🚫❤️
## 2 Timothy 3:4
They will not keep friends. They will be bossy and proud. They will love fun, not God. 🎉>🙏
## 2 Timothy 3:5
They will act good, but they say no to God’s power. You stay away from them. 🎭✋
## 2 Timothy 3:6
Some bad people sneak into homes. They trick weak women who feel bad for wrong. They pull them to want bad things. 🏠🕵️‍♂️
## 2 Timothy 3:7
They learn and learn, but they do not know what is true. 📚❓
## 2 Timothy 3:8
Jannes and Jambres fought Moses long ago. These men also fight the truth. Their minds are bad. They do not stand with God. ✋📖
## 2 Timothy 3:9
But they will not go far. All people will see they are wrong, like before. 🔍🚫

But you, Timothy, keep the things you learned. You know who taught you. 🧠✅
## 2 Timothy 3:15
Since you were a child, you knew God’s Book. It helps you be saved when you believe in Christ Jesus. 👦📖✝️
## 2 Timothy 3:16
All of God’s Book came from God. It is good to teach. It shows what is wrong. It shows how to make it right. It trains us to live good. 📖➡️🧭

Then God’s worker is ready to do every good thing. 🧰✅
