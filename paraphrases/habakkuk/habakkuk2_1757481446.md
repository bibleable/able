## Habakkuk 2:1
Habakkuk said: I will stand and wait like a guard on a wall. I will look and listen for God. 👀🧍‍♂️🧱👂🙏
## Habakkuk 2:2
God said: Write my message. Make it clear. Put it on a big board. So people can read fast. ✍️📜🏃‍♂️
## Habakkuk 2:3
This message is for a set time. It will come. It is true. If it feels slow, wait. It will not be late. ⏳✅
## Habakkuk 2:4
Look at the proud man. He is not right. But the good one lives by believing God. 🚶‍♂️🙏
## Habakkuk 2:5
The bad man drinks and brags. He cannot rest. He wants more and more. He grabs many lands and people. 🍷😡😴❌🌍
## Habakkuk 2:6
All the people will sing a mean song about him: “Sad for the one who takes what is not his. How long?” 🎶😠⏳
## Habakkuk 2:7
The ones you owe will wake up fast. They will scare you. They will take from you. ⏰😨🔄
## Habakkuk 2:8
You hurt many lands and towns. You spilled blood. So they will come and take from you. 🩸🏙️🔁
## Habakkuk 2:9
Sad for the one who gets wrong money for his house. He builds high to feel safe. 🏠💰❌⬆️
## Habakkuk 2:10
You made bad for your own house. You hurt many. You will lose your life. 🏠⚠️
## Habakkuk 2:11
The rocks in the wall will cry out. The wood in the house will answer. 🧱🪵🗣️
## Habakkuk 2:12
Sad for the one who builds a town with blood and harm. 🏗️🩸
## Habakkuk 2:13
God says: People work hard, but it burns up. Big groups get tired for nothing. 🔥😓
## Habakkuk 2:14
One day all the earth will know God, like water fills the sea. 🌊🌍
## Habakkuk 2:15
Sad for the one who gives too much drink to a neighbor to make him drunk and with no clothes. 🍷😵‍♂️🚫👕
## Habakkuk 2:16
You wanted to shame others. Now you will be shamed. You will drink your own cup. God will make it come to you. 🍷🔄
## Habakkuk 2:17
You cut down the big trees in Lebanon. You hurt animals. You spilled blood. You hurt towns and people. Harm will come to you. 🌲🐻🏙️🔁
## Habakkuk 2:18
Idols help no one. People make them from wood or metal. They cannot talk. They tell lies. 🗿🤐
## Habakkuk 2:19
Sad for the one who says to wood or stone, “Wake up!” It may have gold and silver, but it is dead. It cannot teach. 🪵🪨✨😶
## Habakkuk 2:20
But God is in His holy house. Be quiet, all the earth, before Him. 🕊️🏛️🤫
