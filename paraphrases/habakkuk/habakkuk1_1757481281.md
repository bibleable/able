## Habakkuk 1:1
Habakkuk saw a message from God. 👀📜
## Habakkuk 1:2
Habakkuk said to God, “How long? I cry for help, but You do not save yet. Bad men hurt us.” 😢🙏🆘
## Habakkuk 1:3
Habakkuk said, “Why do I see so much bad and hurt? I see fight and harm all day.” 👀😢⚔️
## Habakkuk 1:4
Rules are not used. Right does not win. Bad people trap good people. Judges do not do right. ⚖️❌
## Habakkuk 1:5
God said, “Look at other lands. I will do a big thing. You will not believe it.” 🌍👀✨
## Habakkuk 1:6
God said, “I will bring a big army from Babylon. They are fast and mean. They take homes that are not theirs.” 🛡️⚔️🏇🏘️
## Habakkuk 1:7
They are very scary. They make their own rules. 😨⚖️
## Habakkuk 1:8
Their horses run so fast. The men ride quick. They come like an eagle to eat. 🐎💨🦅
## Habakkuk 1:9
They come to hurt. They grab many people, like sand by the sea. ⚔️😢🏖️
## Habakkuk 1:10
They laugh at kings and rulers. Big walls do not stop them. 👑😂🧱❌
## Habakkuk 1:11
They rush like wind and move on. They do wrong. They think their own strength is like a god. 🌬️➡️💪❌
## Habakkuk 1:12
Habakkuk said, “God, You live forever. You are holy. You set them to punish. You are strong like a rock.” 🙏⛅🕊️🪨
## Habakkuk 1:13
Habakkuk said, “You are too pure to like bad. Why let bad men win? They eat up people who are better than them.” ✨❌😟
## Habakkuk 1:14
People feel like fish in the sea, like little bugs with no leader. 🐟🌊🐛
## Habakkuk 1:15
The bad man catches people like fish with a hook and a net. He is glad. 🪝🕸️😊
## Habakkuk 1:16
He bows to his net and tools. He thinks they feed him and make him rich. 🙇‍♂️🕸️🍞
## Habakkuk 1:17
Habakkuk said, “Will he keep on and on, killing and taking, with no stop?” ❓⛔⚔️
