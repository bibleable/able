James says: With our mouth we say good words to God the Father. With the same mouth we say mean words to people God made. 🙌👄🙂➡️😡

James says: Who is wise? Who can understand? Show it with a good life. Be gentle when you do good. 😊👐
## James 3:14
James says: But if your heart has bitter hate and me-first thinking, do not brag. Do not lie. 💔😠🙅‍♂️
## James 3:15
James says: That kind of “wise” is not from God. It is from this world. It is not from God’s Holy Spirit. It is very bad. 🌍❌
## James 3:16
James says: Where there is me-first and angry hearts, there is a big mess and many bad things. 😡💥

James says: People who make peace plant peace like seeds. They get a big good crop. 🌱🕊️➡️🌾
