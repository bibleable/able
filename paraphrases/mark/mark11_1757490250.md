## Mark 11:17
Jesus taught and said: <jesus>God says, “My house is for prayer for all people.” But you made it a place for bad people.</jesus> 📖🙏🚫

That evening, Jesus and His friends left the city. 🌆🚶‍♂️
## Mark 11:20
In the morning, they saw the fig tree. It was dry from the roots. 🌅🌳🍂

## Mark 11:30
Jesus said: <jesus>John dunked people in water. Was it from God or from people? Tell Me.</jesus> 💧❓
## Mark 11:31
The leaders talked to each other. “If we say, ‘From God,’ He will say, ‘Why did you not believe?’” 🤔🗣️
## Mark 11:32
“But if we say, ‘From people,’ the crowd will be mad.” All the people thought John was a man from God. 😨👥
