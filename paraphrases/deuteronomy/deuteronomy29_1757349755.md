## Deuteronomy 29:4

## Deuteronomy 29:5
God took care of you 40 years in the wild. Your clothes and shoes did not break. 🏜️👟👕
## Deuteronomy 29:6
You did not eat bread. You did not drink wine. So you would know I am God. 🍞🚫🍷🚫🙏
## Deuteronomy 29:7
Then two kings, Sihon of Heshbon, and Og of Bashan, fought you. God helped you win. 👑⚔️🛡️

## Deuteronomy 29:10
All of you stand here today. Leaders and all the men stand here. 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦👑
## Deuteronomy 29:11
Your kids and your wives too. Also new people who live with you. Wood men and water men too. 🧒👩🪵💧
## Deuteronomy 29:12
You stand to make a promise with God today. God will be your God. You will be His people. 🤝🙏❤️
## Deuteronomy 29:13
God said this long ago to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. 👴👴👴📜

## Deuteronomy 29:16
You know we lived in Egypt. We walked by many lands. 👣🌍🇪🇬
## Deuteronomy 29:17
You saw their bad gods made of wood, stone, silver, and gold. 🗿🚫
## Deuteronomy 29:18
Do not let a man, a woman, or a family turn away to bad gods. Do not let a bad root grow poison. 🚫🙏🗿🌱☠️
## Deuteronomy 29:19
Do not say, I will be safe if I do bad. I will do what I want. That is a trap. It hurts all. ⚠️💔
## Deuteronomy 29:20
God will not say it is okay. God will be very mad. Bad words in this book will fall on him. God will take away his name. 😠🔥📖❌
## Deuteronomy 29:21
God will put him away from the people. Bad will come, like this book says. 🚫👥➡️😞
## Deuteronomy 29:22
Kids later and people from far away will see the land is sick. They will ask why. 🧒🌍🤒❓
## Deuteronomy 29:23
The land will be burned and salty. No plants. Like Sodom and Gomorrah. God knocked them down. 🔥🧂🌵🏚️
## Deuteronomy 29:24
All lands will say, Why did God do this? Why so mad? 🌎❓🔥
## Deuteronomy 29:25
They will say, It is because the people left God’s promise. God saved them from Egypt, but they left Him. 🚶‍♂️❌🤝🇪🇬
## Deuteronomy 29:26
They went to other gods. They bowed to them. God did not give those gods to them. 🗿🙏❌
## Deuteronomy 29:27
So God got mad at the land. All the bad things in this book came. 😡🌾⬇️📖
## Deuteronomy 29:28
God pulled the people out of the land and sent them far away. 🌪️🏠➡️🌍
## Deuteronomy 29:29
Some things are God’s secret. But the clear words are for us and our kids, so we can do them. 🤫➡️🧒📖✅
