## Genesis 44:21
You said, Bring the young boy to me 👀🧒.
## Genesis 44:22
We said, The boy cannot leave Dad. If he leaves, Dad may die 🚫🧒👴.
## Genesis 44:23
You said, If the young boy does not come, you will not see me again 🚫👀.

## Genesis 44:28
One son went away. I said, He was hurt by an animal. I have not seen him since 🐾😢.

If you take this boy and harm comes, I will die sad 😭.

So if I go to my dad without the boy, Dad will die 👴💔.
## Genesis 44:31
We will make our old dad die sad if the boy is not with us 😢👴.

## Genesis 44:33
So please let me stay as your servant. Let the boy go home with his brothers 🙏🧍‍♂️🔁🧒.
## Genesis 44:34
I cannot go home if the boy is not with me. I do not want to see my dad hurt 😢🏠.
