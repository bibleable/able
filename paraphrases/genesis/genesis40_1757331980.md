## Genesis 40:6
In the morning, Joseph saw they were sad. 😟
## Genesis 40:7
Joseph said, Why are you sad today? ❓

They said, We had dreams, and no one can tell us what they mean; Joseph said, God can show the meaning, tell me your dreams. 🙏🗣️
## Genesis 40:9
The drink man said, I saw a plant with grapes in my dream. 🍇
## Genesis 40:10
It had three branches; buds came, and grapes grew ripe. 🌱➡️🍇
## Genesis 40:11
I had the king’s cup; I squeezed the grapes into the cup and gave it to the king. 🧉➡️🤴
## Genesis 40:12
Joseph said, Here is the meaning: the three branches mean three days. 3️⃣🗓️
## Genesis 40:13
In three days, the king will give you your job back; you will give the cup to the king again. 😀🧉🤴
## Genesis 40:14
But please think of me when you are OK; be kind and tell the king about me. 🙏
## Genesis 40:15
I was taken from my home, and I did no wrong; I should not be in jail. 🏠➡️⛓️

In the top basket was food for the king, but birds came and ate it from my head. 🐦🧺
