## Jeremiah 2:1
God spoke to Jeremiah. 📣
## Jeremiah 2:2
God said to Jeremiah, Tell the city this: I remember when you loved Me. You came with Me in the wild land. ❤️🏜️
## Jeremiah 2:3
God said, My people were special to Me. I kept you safe. If people hurt you, bad came to them. ⭐🛡️
## Jeremiah 2:4
God said, All of you, listen to God’s word. 👂📖
## Jeremiah 2:5
God said, What did I do wrong? Why did your dads run from Me? They ran to no-help things and became no-help too. ❓🏃‍♂️🪫
## Jeremiah 2:6
You did not ask, Where is God? I took you from Egypt. I led you in a hot, scary land with big holes and no water. 🏜️🔥🚶‍♂️🚱
## Jeremiah 2:7
I brought you to a good land with food. You made My land dirty. You did bad there. 🌾🍇🏠🗑️
## Jeremiah 2:8
Your God’s house helpers did not ask for Me. Teachers forgot Me. Leaders did wrong. Men who speak for God spoke for a fake god, Baal. They chased no-help things. ⛪🙈👑⚠️🗿
## Jeremiah 2:9
So I will talk strong with you. I will talk to your kids too. 🗣️💬👨‍👩‍👧‍👦
## Jeremiah 2:10
Look far west. Look far east. Do other people trade their gods? No. 👀⬅️➡️🌍
## Jeremiah 2:11
But you traded Me, the real God, for fake gods that cannot help. 🔁💔🗿
## Jeremiah 2:12
Sky, be shocked. Be very, very sad at this. 🌌😮😢
## Jeremiah 2:13
You did two bad things. You left Me. I am like fresh water. You made your own jars. They are broken. They hold no water. 2️⃣🚫🚰🧱💦❌
## Jeremiah 2:14
Are My people slaves now? Why are enemies hurting you? ❓⛓️😢
## Jeremiah 2:15
Big lions (enemies) came and roared. They broke your land. Your towns burned and fell. 🦁🔥🏚️
## Jeremiah 2:16
Men from Egypt hit you and took away your pride. 🇪🇬🗡️😞
## Jeremiah 2:17
You did this to you. You left Me when I led you on the good way. 🚶‍♂️➡️❌🙏
## Jeremiah 2:18
Why run to Egypt for help? Why run to Assyria for help? 🏃‍♂️🇪🇬💧🏃‍♂️🏰💧
## Jeremiah 2:19
Your bad will teach you. Your bad will hurt you. Learn this: It is bad and bitter to leave God. You did not fear Me. 📚⚠️😖
## Jeremiah 2:20
I set you free. But you said, I will not obey. On high hills and under green trees you did wrong with fake gods. 🔓🙅‍♀️⛰️🌳🗿
## Jeremiah 2:21
I planted you like a good grape vine. Now you are wild and bad. 🌱🍇➡️🥀
## Jeremiah 2:22
You can wash and wash. But your bad mark stays. I see it. 🧼🧽🚿👀
## Jeremiah 2:23
You say, We did not chase fake gods. But look at what you do. You run like a fast camel. 🗣️❌🗿➡️🐪💨
## Jeremiah 2:24
You are like a wild donkey. You run to do wrong. You do not stop. 🫏💨⚠️
## Jeremiah 2:25
I say, Stop. Do not hurt your feet. Do not make your throat dry. But you say, No. I love other gods. I will go to them. ✋🚫🦶💧🗣️❤️🗿➡️
## Jeremiah 2:26
A thief feels bad when caught. My people feel bad too. Kings, leaders, and God’s house helpers feel bad. 🕵️‍♂️🚨😳👑👨‍👩‍👧‍👦⛪
## Jeremiah 2:27
They say to wood, You are my dad. They say to a rock, You made me. They turn their back to Me, not their face. But when they are in trouble, they say, God, help! 🪵🪨🙈↩️🙏🆘
## Jeremiah 2:28
I say, Where are your fake gods? Let them save you. You have many towns, and you have many fake gods. ❓🗿🆘🏘️➕🗿
## Jeremiah 2:29
Why do you fight Me? You all broke My rules. ⚔️❌📜
## Jeremiah 2:30
I tried to teach you. You would not learn. You even hurt My helpers who speak for Me. 🧑‍🏫🙅‍♂️💔🗣️
## Jeremiah 2:31
My people now, listen. Was I a dark, mean land to you? Why do you say, We are free. We will not come back to You? 👂🌞❓🏞️🗣️🙅‍♂️
## Jeremiah 2:32
Does a girl forget her rings? Does a bride forget her dress? But you forget Me day after day. 💍👰👗🗓️😞
## Jeremiah 2:33
You plan your steps to chase wrong love so well. You even teach bad ways to others. 🦶➡️❤️❌👥📖⚠️
## Jeremiah 2:34
I see blood of good poor people on your clothes. You did not catch them doing wrong. You hurt them. 👗🩸😢
## Jeremiah 2:35
But you say, I did no wrong. God is not mad at me. I will say you did wrong, because you say, I did not do wrong. 🗣️❌😇➡️📣⚠️
## Jeremiah 2:36
Why run here and there to change your way? Egypt will shame you, like Assyria did. 🏃‍♂️↔️😕🇪🇬😳🏰😳
## Jeremiah 2:37
You will leave sad, hands on your head. I say no to the ones you trust. They will not help you. 🚶‍♂️😢🙆‍♂️👐👥❌
