## 2 Corinthians 6:4
We work for God. We keep going in hard times, in pain, in need, and in trouble. 💪😣
## 2 Corinthians 6:5
We were hit. We were in jail. Crowds were wild. We worked hard. We stayed up late. We were hungry. 🥊🚪👥⚒️🌙🍽️
## 2 Corinthians 6:6
We live clean. We know what is true. We wait a long time. We are kind. God’s Holy Spirit helps. We love for real. 🧼📖⏳😊🕊️❤️
## 2 Corinthians 6:7
We speak truth. God’s power helps us. God makes us strong to do right, on both sides. 🗣️✅⚡🛡️
## 2 Corinthians 6:8
People say nice things and mean things. Some call us liars, but we tell the truth. 👍👎🗣️✅

Some do not know us, but many do. It looks like we may die, but we live. We get hurt, but we are not killed. 👤👥⚰️➡️🫀
## 2 Corinthians 6:10
We are sad, but we still sing. We are poor, but we make many rich in God. We have nothing, but in God we have all we need. 😢🎵💸➡️💖👐🙏

## 2 Corinthians 6:14
Do not team up with people who do not believe in Jesus. Right and wrong do not match. Light and dark do not mix. 🚫🤝❌⚖️🌞🌑
## 2 Corinthians 6:15
Jesus and the bad one do not agree. One who believes and one who does not believe do not match. ✝️❌😈✔️❌
## 2 Corinthians 6:16
God’s house and fake gods do not match. You are God’s house. God says, “I live with you. I walk with you. I will be your God. You are my people.” 🏠❌🗿➡️🏠👣💞
## 2 Corinthians 6:17
So, God says, “Come out from them. Be different. Do not touch bad things. I will take you in.” 🚶‍♂️➡️🚪✨✋🧼🤗
## 2 Corinthians 6:18
“I will be your Father. You will be my sons and daughters,” says the Lord, the strong God. 👑👨‍👧‍👦
