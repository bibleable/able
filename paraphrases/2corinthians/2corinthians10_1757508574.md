## 2 Corinthians 10:1
Paul talks to all of you. He asks with Jesus’ kind and gentle way. When he is with you, he is soft. When he is far, he writes strong words. 🤲✍️
## 2 Corinthians 10:2
Paul asks this: when he comes, he does not want to be tough. But he can be brave to some who say Paul lives in a wrong human way. 🙏💬
## 2 Corinthians 10:3
We live like people, but we do not fight like people fight. 🚶‍♂️🛑⚔️
## 2 Corinthians 10:4
Our fight tools are not of this world. God gives us power to break strong bad walls in minds. 🛠️💪✨🧠
## 2 Corinthians 10:5
We stop bad ideas and proud talk that stand against knowing God. We catch each thought and make it obey Jesus. 🧠✋➡️🙏
## 2 Corinthians 10:6
We are ready to stop all not obeying, when all of you obey all the way. ⏱️✅
## 2 Corinthians 10:7
Look with your eyes. If someone says, “I belong to Jesus,” that person should know this: we belong to Jesus too. 👀✝️
## 2 Corinthians 10:8
If Paul brags a little about his right to lead, the Lord Jesus gave it to build you up, not to break you down. Paul is not sorry for that. 🧱⬆️🙂
## 2 Corinthians 10:9
Paul does not want his letters to scare you. 📜😟➡️🕊️
## 2 Corinthians 10:10
Some people say, “His letters are big and strong, but when he is here, he looks weak, and he does not talk well.” 💬📜💪 / 🚶‍♂️😔🗣️
## 2 Corinthians 10:11
That person must know this: what Paul says in letters when far, he will do when he is there. ✍️=🚶‍♂️
## 2 Corinthians 10:12
We will not stand with people who praise self. They look only at self and say, “I am best.” That is not wise. 🚫🏅😕
## 2 Corinthians 10:13
We will not brag past our job. We will talk about the job God gave us. This job came even to you. 🗺️🛤️
## 2 Corinthians 10:14
We are not going too far. We came to you first with the good news of Jesus. ✝️📣➡️🫵
## 2 Corinthians 10:15
We do not brag about work other people did. We hope your trust will grow. Then we can do more work with you. 🌱➡️🌳
## 2 Corinthians 10:16
We want to share the good news in far places past you. We do not want to brag about work others did. 🧭✝️📣
## 2 Corinthians 10:17
If you brag, brag about the Lord. 🙌
## 2 Corinthians 10:18
The one who praises self is not the one who is okay. The Lord is the One who says yes to a person. ✅✝️
