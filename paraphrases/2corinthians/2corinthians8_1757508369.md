## 2 Corinthians 8:1
Paul said, I want you to know how God helped the churches in Macedonia. 🙏💙
## 2 Corinthians 8:2
Those people had big pain and were very poor, but they had big joy and gave a lot. 😔➡️😊🎁
## 2 Corinthians 8:3
They gave as much as they could, and more, by their own choice. 🙌🎁
## 2 Corinthians 8:4
They begged us to let them help God’s people who need help. 👐🙏
## 2 Corinthians 8:5
They gave themselves to the Lord first, and then to us, just like God wanted. ❤️🙇‍♂️
## 2 Corinthians 8:6
So we asked Titus to finish this gift with you, like he started. 📨🏁
## 2 Corinthians 8:7
You do well in faith, words, knowing, care, and love. Do well in giving too. ⭐🗣️📘❤️🎁
## 2 Corinthians 8:8
I am not making a rule. I want to see if your love is real, like their love. 🧡🤝
## 2 Corinthians 8:9
You know about our Lord Jesus Christ. He was rich, but He became poor for you, so you can have what you need. ✝️👑➡️🧥
## 2 Corinthians 8:10
Here is my kind think. This helps you. Last year you started to want to give and to do it. 📅📝🎁
## 2 Corinthians 8:11
Now finish it. Do it with what you have. ✅🏁🎁
## 2 Corinthians 8:12
If you want to give, God sees your heart. Give from what you have, not what you do not have. 💛👀🎁
## 2 Corinthians 8:13
We do not want others to rest while you hurt. We want fair. ⚖️
## 2 Corinthians 8:14
Now you have more. Help them. Later they may help you. Then it is fair. 🔄🤝
## 2 Corinthians 8:15
It says, the one who got much had no extra, and the one who got little had enough. 🍞🥣
## 2 Corinthians 8:16
Thank God. He put the same care for you in Titus. 🙏💚
## 2 Corinthians 8:17
Titus said yes. He cares a lot. He is coming to you by his own choice. 🧍‍♂️➡️🏙️
## 2 Corinthians 8:18
A brother will go with him. Many churches know him for the good news of Jesus. 👬📣✝️
## 2 Corinthians 8:19
The churches picked him to travel with us to carry the gift, to make the Lord glad and show our good heart. 🧳🎁🙌
## 2 Corinthians 8:20
We do this so no one can say we did wrong with the big gift. 🛡️🎁
## 2 Corinthians 8:21
We try to do what is good and right to the Lord and to people. ✅👀
## 2 Corinthians 8:22
We send another brother too. We tried him many times. He cares a lot. He feels sure about you. 👤👍💪
## 2 Corinthians 8:23
Titus is my helper and friend in work for you. The other men are church helpers. They make Jesus look good. 🤝⛪✝️
## 2 Corinthians 8:24
So show your love to them. Show all the churches that what I said about you is true. 💗👀✅
