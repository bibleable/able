Day 3, Queen Esther put on her nice dress. She stood inside the king’s big house. The king sat on his big chair. 👗🏰👑
## Esther 5:2
The king saw Esther. He was happy to see her and held out his gold stick. Esther came close and touched the tip. 😊✨
## Esther 5:3
The king said, What do you want, Queen Esther? I will give you a lot, even half my land. 🗣️🎁
## Esther 5:4
Esther said, Please come to a food party I made today. Bring Haman too. 🍞🍇
## Esther 5:5
The king said, Hurry! Bring Haman. We will do what Esther said. They went to the party. 🏃‍♂️➡️🍽️
## Esther 5:6
At the party they ate and drank. The king said again, What do you want? I can give a lot, even half my land. 🍵🍞
## Esther 5:7
Esther said, I have a big ask. 🗣️
## Esther 5:8
If the king likes me, please come with Haman to one more party tomorrow. Then I will tell you my ask. 📅🍽️
## Esther 5:9
Haman left happy. But he saw Mordecai at the gate. Mordecai did not stand for him. Haman got very mad. 🙂➡️😡
## Esther 5:10
Haman held it in and went home. He called his friends and his wife Zeresh to come. 🏠👨‍👩‍👧‍👦
## Esther 5:11
Haman told them, I am rich. I have many kids. The king made me big and important over others. 💰👦👧⬆️
## Esther 5:12
Haman said, The queen asked only me and the king to her party. She asked me again for tomorrow too. 🎉👑
## Esther 5:13
But Haman said, All this is nothing while I see Mordecai sit at the gate. 🚪
## Esther 5:14
His wife Zeresh and friends said, Make a very tall pole. In the morning, ask the king to kill Mordecai on it. Then go happy to the party. Haman liked this bad plan and made the tall pole. 🪵⬆️😞
