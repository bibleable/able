## Esther 4:3
In many lands, the Jews were very sad. They cried and did not eat. Many sat in dust and wore sad clothes. 😢🍞🚫💧🚫
## Esther 4:4
Esther’s helpers told her. Esther was very upset. She sent clean clothes for Mordecai, but he would not take them. 👗❌
## Esther 4:5
Esther called Hatach, the king’s helper for her. She said, Go ask Mordecai what is wrong and why. 🏃‍♂️❓
## Esther 4:6
Hatach went to Mordecai at the big open place by the king’s gate. 🏛️🚶‍♂️
## Esther 4:7

## Esther 4:8
Mordecai gave Hatach a copy of the king’s paper rule. He said, Show this to Esther and tell her to ask the king to help her people. 📜👉👑

## Esther 4:11
Esther said, Everyone knows the rule: if a man or woman goes in to the king and he did not call, that person must die. Only if the king lifts the gold stick can the person live. The king has not called me for 30 days. 👑🪄❌⏳
## Esther 4:12
The helpers told Mordecai what Esther said. 🗣️➡️

## Esther 4:15
Then Esther sent a new word to Mordecai. 🔄
## Esther 4:16
