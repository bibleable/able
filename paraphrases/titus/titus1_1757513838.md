## Titus 1:1
Paul says, “I am God’s helper. Jesus sent me. I help God’s people trust and know the true way to live good.” 🙋‍♂️🙏✝️
## Titus 1:2
We hope to live with God for ever. God does not lie. Long ago, God said He would do this. 🌟⏳
## Titus 1:3
At the right time, God let me tell His word. God told me to preach. God saves us. 🕰️📣📖
## Titus 1:4
To Titus, my true son in the same faith: May God the Father and Christ Jesus give you kind gift and peace. 👋💌🕊️
## Titus 1:5
I left you in Crete. Fix what is not set. Pick leaders in each town, like I said. 📍🏝️👨‍👩‍👧‍👦
## Titus 1:6
A leader must be a good man. He has one wife. His kids obey and do not act wild or bad. 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦✅
## Titus 1:7
A leader for God must be very good. Not proud. Not quick mad. Not drink too much. Not fight. Not love money. 🚫😡🍷🥊💰
## Titus 1:8
He must be kind. He likes good. He can stop self. He is fair. He is close to God. He keeps rules. 🏠❤️👍
## Titus 1:9
He holds on to the true word. He can teach the good truth. He can stop people who say wrong. 📚🛡️🗣️
## Titus 1:10
Some people do not obey. They talk empty words. They try to trick. Some push old rules. 🗣️❌🎭
## Titus 1:11
Make them quiet. They hurt homes. They teach wrong to get money. 🤫🏠💔💰
## Titus 1:12
A man from Crete said, “Cretan people lie, act bad, and are lazy and eat too much.” 🧍‍♂️🗣️😕
## Titus 1:13
This is true. Tell them strong words, so they can be strong in trust in God. ✅⚠️💪
## Titus 1:14
Do not follow fake tales or people rules that pull you from the true way. 🚫📕🚫👂
## Titus 1:15
If your heart is clean, many things seem clean. If your heart is bad and you do not trust, nothing seems clean. Your mind and heart are dirty then. 💖✨🧠🫀
## Titus 1:16
Some say, “We know God,” but their acts say “No.” They do not obey. They are not fit to do good work. 🗣️❌🚫🧹
