## Job 35:5
Look up at the sky. See the clouds. They are high over you. 🌌☁️⬆️
## Job 35:6
If you do wrong, you do not hurt God. God is still God. ✋🙅‍♂️🙏

## Job 35:12
They cry, but no one answers, because bad men are too proud. 😭🙉😔
## Job 35:13
God does not listen to fake words. God does not like that. 🙉❌🗨️
