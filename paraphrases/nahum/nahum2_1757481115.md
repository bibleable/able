## Nahum 2:1
An enemy comes to Nineveh. Guard the wall. Watch the road. Be brave. Be strong. 🛡️👀🧱💪
## Nahum 2:2
God will make His people, Jacob and Israel, strong again. Bad men hurt them before and broke many things. 🙏❤️
## Nahum 2:3
The enemy soldiers hold red shields and wear red. War carts shine. Long sticks for war wave high. 🔴🛡️🚗✨
## Nahum 2:4
War carts race in the streets. They go fast in the big open places. They shine like fire and flash like lightning. 🚗💨🔥⚡
## Nahum 2:5
The king calls his leaders. They run fast and trip. They hurry to the wall and set a big war tower. 🏃‍♂️🏰
## Nahum 2:6
The river gates open. The king’s big house falls down. 🌊🚪🏚️
## Nahum 2:7
The queen is taken away. Her maids cry loud like doves and hit their chests. 👑😭🕊️
## Nahum 2:8
Nineveh is like a pool with water running away. People shout, “Stop! Stop!” But no one stops or comes back. 🏞️🏃‍♀️🏃‍♂️
## Nahum 2:9
The enemy says, “Take the silver! Take the gold!” There is so much treasure. 🪙💰
## Nahum 2:10
The city is empty and broken. Hearts melt, knees shake, and faces turn pale. 🥶😨
## Nahum 2:11
Where is the lions’ den now? Where big lions and baby lions ate and no one came near? 🦁❓
## Nahum 2:12
The lion got food for his babies and their moms. He filled his caves with meat. 🦁🍖
## Nahum 2:13
God says He is against Nineveh. He will burn the war carts. A sword will stop the strong young men. He will stop them from taking things. Their news men will be quiet. 🔥🗡️🤫
