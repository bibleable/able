Nahum wrote a message from God for the city Nineveh. 📜🏙️
## Nahum 1:2
God is the boss. He cares a lot. He gets mad at bad. He will stop His enemies. 💪⚖️😠
## Nahum 1:3
God waits before He gets mad. He is very strong. He will not let bad go free. He walks in big wind and storm. Clouds are like dust at His feet. 🌪️🌩️☁️
## Nahum 1:4
God says, “Stop,” to the sea, and it is dry. Rivers stop. Plants dry up. Flowers fall. 🌊✋🌵🌼⬇️
## Nahum 1:5
Big mountains shake. Hills melt like wax. The land shakes. All people feel it. ⛰️🫨🌍
## Nahum 1:6
No one can stand when God is mad. His anger is like fire. Rocks break. 🔥🪨💥
## Nahum 1:7
God is good. He is a safe place in bad time. He knows the ones who run to Him. 🛡️❤️🏃‍♂️
## Nahum 1:8
But God will wash away bad with a big flood. He will chase His enemies into the dark. 🌊🏃‍♂️🌑

Do not plan against God. God will stop it. Bad will not come back again. ✋🧠❌
