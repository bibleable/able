## Isaiah 5:1
Isaiah sang a song about his good friend and a grape farm on a nice hill. 🎵🍇⛰️
## Isaiah 5:2
The friend dug the dirt, took out rocks, planted the best grape vines, made a fence and a tall stand, and a place to make juice; he hoped for sweet grapes, but it grew bad, sour grapes. 🧑‍🌾🪨🍇➡️😖
## Isaiah 5:3
Isaiah said to the people in the city and the land, please judge my friend and his grape farm. 🗣️🏘️⚖️
## Isaiah 5:4
My friend did all he could; why did it make sour grapes, not good grapes? 🤔🍇😣
## Isaiah 5:5
My friend said, I will take away the fence; the farm will be open; animals will eat it, and people will step on it. 🐄🚫🪵👣
## Isaiah 5:6
I will let the farm get wild; no one will cut or dig; thorns and weeds will grow; I will tell the clouds to give no rain. 🌵🌿☁️🚫🌧️
## Isaiah 5:7
The grape farm means God’s people; God wanted fair and good, but He saw hurt and cries. 🍇➡️👨‍👩‍👧‍👦⚖️😢
## Isaiah 5:8
Sad for people who grab house to house and field to field, so no space is left and they live alone. 🏠➕🏠➕🏠😠
## Isaiah 5:9
God said, many big homes will be empty; no one will live there. 🏚️😶
## Isaiah 5:10
Big fields will grow very little food; a lot of work will make a tiny bit. 🌾➡️🥄
## Isaiah 5:11
Sad for people who get up early to drink wine and drink all day till night. 🕖🍷➡️🌙
## Isaiah 5:12
They like music and parties and wine, but they do not look at God’s work or what He does. 🎶🎉🍷🚫🙏
## Isaiah 5:13
So the people will be taken away; they will be hungry and thirsty. 🚶‍♂️🚶‍♀️➡️🍽️🚫💧
## Isaiah 5:14
The grave opens wide, and many proud people go down. ⚰️🕳️⬇️
## Isaiah 5:15
People will be brought down; the proud will be made low. ⬇️😔
## Isaiah 5:16
God will be high and fair; He shows He is holy by doing right. 🙏⬆️⚖️
## Isaiah 5:17
Lambs will eat in the fields; poor folks will eat in the empty rich places. 🐑🌿🍽️
## Isaiah 5:18
Sad for people who pull sin with lies, like a rope pulls a cart. 🪢🛒😞
## Isaiah 5:19
They say, “Hurry, God, do it now so we can see,” and they make fun of God. ⏩👀😏
## Isaiah 5:20
Sad for people who say bad is good and good is bad, dark is light and light is dark, yucky is sweet and sweet is yucky. ⚫↔️⚪🍋↔️🍭
## Isaiah 5:21
Sad for people who think they are so wise and smart. 😎🙅
## Isaiah 5:22
Sad for strong drinkers who show off at mixing strong wine. 🍷💪😒
## Isaiah 5:23
They take money to say bad people are not guilty, and they hurt good people and take away what is right. 💰🚫⚖️
## Isaiah 5:24
So fire will eat them like dry straw; their root will rot; their flower will blow away like dust, because they said no to God’s law and God’s word. 🔥🌾➡️🗑️
## Isaiah 5:25
God was angry and hit them; hills shook; many died; but His anger was not done; His hand was still up. ⚡⛰️😨
## Isaiah 5:26
God raised a flag and called a far land; He whistled, and they came fast. 🚩📯🏃‍♂️💨
## Isaiah 5:27
The army was not tired; no one tripped; no one slept; belts were tight; shoes were fine. 🛡️👟💤🚫
## Isaiah 5:28
Their arrows were sharp; bows were ready; horse feet were like hard rock; war carts ran fast like big wind. 🏹🐎💨
## Isaiah 5:29
They roared like lions; they grabbed and carried people off; no one saved them. 🦁📣🙀
## Isaiah 5:30
That day they roared like the sea; the land looked dark and sad; the light was dark with clouds. 🌊🌫️🌑
