## Zechariah 1:1
In month 8, year 2 of King Darius, God spoke to the man Zechariah, son of Berechiah, son of Iddo. 🗓️👑📣
## Zechariah 1:2
God was very mad at the dads long ago. 😠
## Zechariah 1:3
God said, Come back to Me, and I will come back to you. ↩️❤️
## Zechariah 1:4
Do not be like the dads long ago; they did not listen when men from God said, Turn back to God. 🙅‍♂️👂
## Zechariah 1:5
Where are your dads now? The men from God did not live forever. ⌛
## Zechariah 1:6
But God’s words came true; the people said, God did what He said. ✅
## Zechariah 1:7
On day 24 of month 11, year 2 of King Darius, God spoke to Zechariah again. 📅👑
## Zechariah 1:8
At night, Zechariah saw a man on a red horse by trees; more horses stood behind him, red, brown, and white. 🌙🐎🌳
## Zechariah 1:9
Zechariah said, What is this? An angel talked with him and said, I will show you. ❓👼
## Zechariah 1:10
The man by the trees said, God sent these riders to look all over the earth. 👀🌍
## Zechariah 1:11
The riders said to the angel, We went all over the earth, and it is quiet and still. 🐎🌍🤫
## Zechariah 1:12
The angel prayed to God, How long until You are kind again to Jerusalem and the towns of Judah? It has been 70 years. 🙏⏳
## Zechariah 1:13
God answered the angel with good words and kind words. 💬❤️
## Zechariah 1:14
The angel said to Zechariah, Tell the people: God’s love for Jerusalem and Zion is big; He cares a lot. 📣💖
## Zechariah 1:15
God said, I am very mad at the other lands; I was a little mad, but they made the hurt bigger. 😠🌍
## Zechariah 1:16
God said, I come back to Jerusalem with kind care; My big God house will be built there, and people will measure the city again. 🏠📏
## Zechariah 1:17
God said, My towns will be full and safe again; I will hug Zion; I pick Jerusalem again. 🏙️🤗✨
## Zechariah 1:18
Then Zechariah looked up and saw four big horns. 4️⃣🐂
## Zechariah 1:19
Zechariah asked the angel, What is this? The angel said, These horns hurt Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem; they made the people run. ❓👼➡️
## Zechariah 1:20
Then God showed Zechariah four makers, work men with tools. 👷‍♂️👷‍♀️🛠️
## Zechariah 1:21
Zechariah asked, What will they do? The angel said, The makers will scare the horns and break them; the horns from other lands hurt Judah, but the makers will stop them. 💪🛠️❌
