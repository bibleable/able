## John 11:1
A man named Lazarus was sick. He lived in Bethany with his sisters, Mary and Martha. 🏠🤒
## John 11:2
Mary was the woman who put sweet oil on Jesus and wiped His feet with her hair. 💐👣
## John 11:3
The sisters sent a note to Jesus to say, “Lazarus is sick.” 📩
## John 11:4
Jesus said, <jesus>This sickness will not end in death. It will show God’s power.</jesus> ✨
## John 11:5
Jesus loved Martha, Mary, and Lazarus. ❤️
## John 11:6
But He waited two more days before He went. ⏳
## John 11:7
Then Jesus said to His friends, <jesus>Let us go back to Judea.</jesus> 🚶‍♂️
## John 11:8
His friends said, “People there wanted to hurt You. Do You want to go back?” ⚠️
## John 11:9
Jesus said, <jesus>There is day to walk in. If you walk in the light, you do not trip.</jesus> ☀️🚶
## John 11:10
Jesus said, <jesus>If you walk in the dark, you trip, because there is no light.</jesus> 🌑🚫
## John 11:11
Then Jesus said, <jesus>Our friend Lazarus is sleeping. I will go wake him.</jesus> 😴⏰
## John 11:12
The friends said, “Lord, if he sleeps, he will get well.” 💭
## John 11:13
But Jesus meant Lazarus had died. 💔
## John 11:14
Then Jesus said plain, <jesus>Lazarus is dead.</jesus> 🕊️
## John 11:15
Jesus said, <jesus>I am glad for you that I was not there, so you will trust Me. Let us go to him.</jesus> 🚶‍♂️
## John 11:16
Thomas (the Twin) said to the friends, “Let us go too, so we may die with Him.” 🧍🧍
## John 11:17
Jesus came and saw Lazarus had been in a cave for the dead for four days. 🪦
## John 11:18
Bethany was near the big city Jerusalem, not far. 🗺️
## John 11:19
Many people came to Martha and Mary to help them feel better. 🤝😢
## John 11:20
Martha heard Jesus was coming and went to meet Him. Mary stayed at home. 🏃‍♀️🏠
## John 11:21
Martha said to Jesus, “If You had been here, my brother would not have died.” 😢
## John 11:22
She said she knew God would give Jesus what He asked. 🙏
## John 11:23
Jesus said, <jesus>Your brother will live again.</jesus> ✨
## John 11:24
Martha said, “I know he will live again on the last day.” 📅
## John 11:25
Jesus said, <jesus>I make dead people live again. I am the life. If a person trusts Me, even if he dies, he will live.</jesus> ✝️💖
## John 11:26
Jesus said, <jesus>Everyone who lives and trusts Me will have life that never ends. Do you believe this?</jesus> ❓
## John 11:27
She said, “Yes, Lord. I believe You are God’s Son, the promised One.” 🙌
## John 11:28
She went and told Mary in secret, “The Teacher is here and is calling you.” 🤫👂
## John 11:29
Mary got up fast and went to Him. 🏃‍♀️
## John 11:30
Jesus had not come into the town yet. He was still where Martha met Him. 🚶‍♂️
## John 11:31
The people in the house saw Mary get up fast and go out. They thought she was going to the cave to cry, so they went with her. 😢🚶‍♀️🚶
## John 11:32
Mary came to Jesus, fell at His feet, and said, “If You had been here, my brother would not have died.” 😭👣
## John 11:33
When Jesus saw Mary cry and the people cry, He felt very sad and upset inside. 😢💔
## John 11:34
Jesus asked, <jesus>Where did you put him?</jesus> They said, “Lord, come and see.” 👣
## John 11:35
Jesus cried. 😢
## John 11:36
The people said, “See how He loved him.” ❤️
## John 11:37
Some said, “He helped a man who could not see. Could He not keep Lazarus from dying?” 👀❓
## John 11:38
Jesus, still very sad, came to the cave. A big rock was on it. 🪦🪨
## John 11:39
Jesus said, <jesus>Move the rock.</jesus> Martha said, “Lord, it has been four days. It will smell bad.” 🪨🚫
## John 11:40
Jesus said, <jesus>Did I not tell you that if you trust, you will see God’s power?</jesus> ✨
## John 11:41
They moved the rock. Jesus looked up and said, <jesus>Father, thank You for hearing Me.</jesus> 🙏
## John 11:42
Jesus said, <jesus>I know You always hear Me. I say this for the people here, so they will trust You sent Me.</jesus> 📣
## John 11:43
Then Jesus called loud, <jesus>Lazarus, come out!</jesus> 📢
## John 11:44
Lazarus came out, his hands and feet tied with cloth. Jesus said, <jesus>Take off the cloth and let him go.</jesus> 🧻➡️
## John 11:45
Many people who came and saw what Jesus did trusted Him. 😀
## John 11:46
But some went to the leaders and told what Jesus did. 🗣️🏛️
## John 11:47
The top leaders met and said, “What should we do? This man does many big things.” 🧑‍⚖️🤔
## John 11:48
They said, “If we let Him keep doing this, all will trust Him, and the big bosses may take our place and our land.” 🏛️😟
## John 11:49
One leader named Caiaphas, the top leader that year, said, “You know nothing.” 🧑‍⚖️
## John 11:50
He said, “It is better that one man die for the people than all the people be lost.” ⚖️
## John 11:51
He did not know it, but God used his words: Jesus would die for the people. ✝️
## John 11:52
And not only for those people, but to bring together God’s kids who are far away. 🌍👨‍👩‍👧‍👦
## John 11:53
From that day the leaders planned to kill Jesus. 🗓️⚔️
## John 11:54
So Jesus did not walk openly now. He went to a town called Ephraim near the wild place and stayed there with His friends. 🏞️
## John 11:55
A big God day was near. Many people went up to the big city to get ready. 🕊️🚶‍♂️
## John 11:56
They looked for Jesus in God’s house and said to each other, “What do you think? Will He come to the big day?” 🏛️❓
## John 11:57
The top leaders said, “If anyone knows where He is, tell us, so we can take Him.” 📣🚓
