## John 2:1
On day three, there was a wedding in Cana, in Galilee. Jesus’ mom was there. 🎉🤵👰
## John 2:2
Jesus and His friends were asked to come to the wedding too. 😊🎉
## John 2:3
The drink ran out. Jesus’ mom told Him, “They have no drink.” 🥤❌
## John 2:4
Jesus said to His mom, <jesus>“Mom, it is not time yet.”</jesus> ⏰✋
## John 2:5
His mom told the helpers, “Do what He says.” 👂✅
## John 2:6
Six big stone jars were there for wash. They could hold a lot of water. 🪨🫙💧
## John 2:7
Jesus said, <jesus>“Fill the big jars with water.”</jesus> The helpers filled them to the top. 💧🫙⬆️
## John 2:8
He said, <jesus>“Scoop some out. Take it to the meal boss.”</jesus> They took it. 🥄➡️🍽️
## John 2:9
The meal boss tasted the water. Now it was good drink. He did not know where it came from. The helpers knew. He called the groom. 😮➡️😋📣🤵
## John 2:10
He said, “People give good drink first. Later they give not-so-good drink. But you kept the best drink for now!” 🗣️👍🥤
## John 2:11
This was Jesus’ first big work. He did it in Cana. It showed He is strong. His friends trusted Him. ✨🙌
## John 2:12
After this, He went to a town by the lake, Capernaum. His mom, His brothers, and His friends went too. They stayed a few days. 🚶‍♂️🏘️🌊⏳
## John 2:13
It was a big God day. Jesus went to the big city, Jerusalem. 🛐🏙️
## John 2:14
In God’s house, He saw people sell cows, sheep, and doves. Money men sat there too. 🐄🐑🕊️💰
## John 2:15
He made a small rope whip. He sent out the cows and sheep. He spilled the coins. He pushed the tables over. 🪢➡️🐄🐑💰🌀🪑
## John 2:16
He said to the dove sellers, <jesus>“Take this out! Do not make My Father’s house a store.”</jesus> 🕊️🚫🏠🛒
## John 2:17
His friends remembered an old book line: “I love Your house so much.” 📖❤️🏠
## John 2:18
The leaders said to Him, “Show us why You do this. Show a big work.” 🧑‍⚖️❓
## John 2:19
Jesus said, <jesus>“If you break this house, I will make it new in 3 days.”</jesus> 🏠🧱➡️⏳3️⃣🔼
## John 2:20
The leaders said, “It took 46 years to build this big house. Can You fix it in 3 days?” 🕰️4️⃣6️⃣➡️3️⃣🤔
## John 2:21
But He meant His body, not the building. 🙇‍♂️➡️🚶‍♂️
## John 2:22
Later, after He came back to life, His friends remembered His words. They believed the old book and what Jesus said. ✝️🌅🧠✅
## John 2:23
In the big city on the big God day, many people saw His big works. Many people believed in His name. 🏙️👀✨➡️🙏
## John 2:24
But Jesus did not trust them. He knew all people. 🤝❌👀
## John 2:25
No one had to tell Him about people. He knew what was in each heart. ❤️🧠
