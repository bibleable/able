## Amos 5:7
You make good turn bad. You push right down to the ground. ⬆️good➡️bad⬇️

God can smash strong towns and big walls. 💥🏰
## Amos 5:10
You hate the helper at the town gate. You hate the one who tells the truth. 🚪🙅‍♂️🗣️
## Amos 5:11
You step on poor people and take their money. You build stone houses but will not live in them. You plant grape fields but will not drink the juice. 💸🏚️🍇🚫🥤
## Amos 5:12
God says: I see your many bad things. You hurt good people. You take secret pay. You push poor people away at the town gate. 👀✋😠

So smart people are quiet now. The time is bad. 🤐⏳
## Amos 5:14
Look for good, not bad, so you can live. Then God will be with you. 👀✅🚫❌🙂

Hate bad. Love good. Make the town gate fair. Maybe God will be kind to the small group left in Joseph’s family. ❌😡 ✅❤️ ⚖️🙂
## Amos 5:16
God says: People will cry in all streets. They will call farmers to cry. They will call people who sing sad songs. 😢🚶‍♂️🚶‍♀️👨‍🌾🎶
## Amos 5:17
People will cry in the grape fields. God will pass through your land. 🍇😭👣
## Amos 5:18
Bad for you who want God’s day. Why do you want it? It is dark, not light. ⚠️🌑

You bring Me gifts and food gifts, but I will not take them. 🎁🍞🚫
## Amos 5:23
Stop your loud songs. I will not listen to your music. 🙉🎵🚫
## Amos 5:24
But let fair and right flow like water, like a big stream. 🌊⚖️
## Amos 5:25
Did you bring Me gifts for 40 years in the wild, Israel? ⛺⏱️4️⃣0️⃣
## Amos 5:26
No. You carried your fake king and your star god, the little idols you made. ⭐👑🗿
## Amos 5:27
So I will send you far away, past a town named Damascus. God says this. 🧭🏜️➡️
