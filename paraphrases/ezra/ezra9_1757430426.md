## Ezra 9:1
Some leaders came to Ezra. They said the people and the helpers at God’s house did not stay away from people in other lands. They did bad like them. 🧑‍💼➡️Ezra📣😟
## Ezra 9:2
They said, “Many men married women from other lands. Even leaders did this wrong.” 💍🌍
## Ezra 9:3
Ezra heard this. He tore his clothes, pulled his hair, and sat down very sad and very surprised. 😢🧵✂️🧑‍🦲
## Ezra 9:4
People who love God’s rules came and sat with Ezra. They shook with fear because of the wrong. Ezra sat there until evening time. 🧎‍♂️🧎‍♀️⏳🌅
## Ezra 9:5
At evening time, Ezra got up. He went on his knees and lifted his hands to God and prayed. 🙏🕯️
## Ezra 9:6
Ezra said, “My God, I feel so bad. I cannot look up. Our wrong is so big. It is up high like the sky.” 😔☁️
## Ezra 9:7
He said, “For a long time we did wrong. So we had much trouble. We were taken far away. We felt shame.” 🧳😞
## Ezra 9:8
“But now You were kind to us for a little time. You left a small group of us safe. You gave us a small safe place at Your house. You made our eyes bright again. You gave us a little new life, even when we were not free.” ✨🏠💡
## Ezra 9:9
“We were not free. But You, our God, did not leave us. You made kings kind to us. We fixed Your house. We fixed the broken places. We had help and a wall in Judah and Jerusalem.” 🧱👑🏗️
## Ezra 9:10
“And now, our God, what can we say? We broke Your rules.” 😞📜
## Ezra 9:11
“You told us by Your men who talk for You: ‘This land is dirty with bad ways from the people here. Do not live like them.’” 🗣️🧼🚫
## Ezra 9:12
“‘Do not give your girls to their boys. Do not take their girls for your boys. Do not be close friends with them. Then you will be strong. You will have good food. Your kids will have this land.’” 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦🍞💪🌾
## Ezra 9:13
“After all our wrong, You gave us less trouble than we should get. You still saved us a little.” 🙌
## Ezra 9:14
“Should we do wrong again and marry people who do bad gods? Will You not be angry? Will our small group be gone?” ⚠️💔
## Ezra 9:15
“O Lord, God of Israel, You are good and fair. A small group is left today. We stand before You. We did wrong. We cannot stand strong before You.” 🙇‍♂️
