## 1 Corinthians 12:1
Paul said, “Friends, I want to teach you about gifts from God's Holy Spirit.” 🎁🕊️
## 1 Corinthians 12:2
Paul said, “Before, you did not know God. You went to fake gods that could not talk.” 🚫🗿
## 1 Corinthians 12:3
Paul said, “God's Holy Spirit helps us talk right. No one with God's Holy Spirit says bad of Jesus. Only with God's Holy Spirit can a person say, ‘Jesus is my boss.’” 🕊️🗣️✝️
## 1 Corinthians 12:4
There are many gifts. But God's Holy Spirit is the same One who gives them. 🎁🕊️
## 1 Corinthians 12:5
There are many ways to serve. But Jesus is the same Lord we serve. 🙌✝️
## 1 Corinthians 12:6
There are many works to do. But the same God gives power to all. 💪✨
## 1 Corinthians 12:7
God's Holy Spirit gives each one a gift to help all of us. 🕊️🤝
## 1 Corinthians 12:8
One gets wise help (wisdom). Another gets to know things (knowledge). God's Holy Spirit gives both. 🧠🕊️
## 1 Corinthians 12:9
Another gets big trust in God (faith). Another gets power to heal sick people. 🫶🤒➡️😊
## 1 Corinthians 12:10
Another does big God acts (miracles). Another says God words. Another can tell good or bad spirit. Another talks in new words. Another can explain the new words. ✨🗣️🔍🗨️➡️💬
## 1 Corinthians 12:11
One and the same God's Holy Spirit does all this. He gives to each one as He wants. 🕊️🎁
## 1 Corinthians 12:12
Our body is one body, but it has many parts. It is like that with Jesus’ people too. 🧍‍♂️🧩
## 1 Corinthians 12:13
God's Holy Spirit made all of us one body. He made us drink of Him, the same Spirit. We are one. 🕊️💧1️⃣
## 1 Corinthians 12:14
One body is not just one part. It has many parts. 🧩➕🧩
## 1 Corinthians 12:15
If the foot says, “I am not a hand, so I am not part,” that is not true. The foot is still part. 🦶✋
## 1 Corinthians 12:16
If the ear says, “I am not an eye, so I am not part,” that is not true. The ear is still part. 👂👁️
## 1 Corinthians 12:17
If all was an eye, we could not hear. If all was an ear, we could not smell. 👁️❓👂👃
## 1 Corinthians 12:18
God put each part in the body just right. God chose it. ✋🦶👂👁️➡️🧍‍♀️
## 1 Corinthians 12:19
If all were one part, then it would not be a body. ❌🧩
## 1 Corinthians 12:20
Now there are many parts, but one body. ✅🧍‍♂️
## 1 Corinthians 12:21
The eye cannot say to the hand, “I do not need you.” The head cannot say to the feet, “I do not need you.” 👁️➡️✋❌ | 🧠➡️🦶❌
## 1 Corinthians 12:22
The parts that seem weak are very needed. 💪🧩
## 1 Corinthians 12:23
The parts we think are not nice to show, we cover and care for more. 🫶🧣
## 1 Corinthians 12:24
The parts that look fine do not need that. God made the body and gave more care to the parts that lacked. 🧍‍♀️❤️
## 1 Corinthians 12:25
God did this so the body will not split. All the parts care for each other. 🤝🧩
## 1 Corinthians 12:26
If one part hurts, all hurt. If one part is praised, all cheer. 😢➡️😢 | 🎉➡️🎉
## 1 Corinthians 12:27
You are Jesus’ body here. Each one of you is a part. ✝️🧍‍♀️🧍‍♂️🧍
## 1 Corinthians 12:28
God put helpers in God’s family: first some who go out to tell good news, then some who say God words, then teachers, then miracle workers, then people who heal, then helpers, then leaders who guide, then people who talk in new words. 🗺️🗣️👩‍🏫✨🩹🤝🧭💬
## 1 Corinthians 12:29
Is everyone a go-out helper? Is everyone a say-God-words helper? Is everyone a teacher? Is everyone a miracle worker? ❓❓❓
## 1 Corinthians 12:30
Does everyone heal? Does everyone talk in new words? Does everyone explain the new words? ❓❓❓
## 1 Corinthians 12:31
Want the best gifts. And I will show you the best way. It is God’s love. 🎁➡️❤️
