## 1 Corinthians 3:1
Paul says: I could not talk to you all like big, God-strong people. I had to talk like babies in Jesus. 🗣️👶✝️
## 1 Corinthians 3:2
I gave you milk, not hard food, because you were not ready. You are still not ready. 🍼🚫🍞
## 1 Corinthians 3:3
You still fuss and fight. You want to be first. This is not God’s way. 😠🤼‍♂️🚫
## 1 Corinthians 3:4
Some of you say, “I am with Paul.” Some say, “I am with Apollos.” You are picking teams. 🙋‍♂️➡️Paul | 🙋‍♀️➡️Apollos 🏷️
## 1 Corinthians 3:5
Who are Paul and Apollos? We are helpers. God gave each a job so you could trust Him. 🤝🧰🙏
## 1 Corinthians 3:6
I planted the seed. Apollos gave water. God made it grow. 🌱💧⬆️
## 1 Corinthians 3:7
The planter is not big. The water helper is not big. God makes it grow. 🙏🌱
## 1 Corinthians 3:8
The planter and the water helper are one team. God will give each one a good thank-you for the work. 👥🤝✅🎁
## 1 Corinthians 3:9
We work with God. You all are like God’s farm and God’s house. 🚜🌾🏠
## 1 Corinthians 3:10
God helped me. I was like a good builder. I put down the base. Others build on it. Be careful how you build. 🧱🛠️🏗️⚠️
## 1 Corinthians 3:11
No one can make a new base. The base is Jesus. Jesus is God’s Son. Jesus loves us. ✝️🧱❤️
## 1 Corinthians 3:12
Some build with gold, silver, and jewels. Some build with wood, hay, and straw. 🪙🥈💎🪵🌾🧺
## 1 Corinthians 3:13
One day, the work will show what it is. Fire will test it. 🔥🔎
## 1 Corinthians 3:14
If the building stands, the builder gets a good gift. 🏠💪🎁
## 1 Corinthians 3:15
If it burns up, the builder loses the work. He is still safe with God, but it is hard. 🔥😢🙏
## 1 Corinthians 3:16
Do you know? You are God’s temple, God’s house. God’s Holy Spirit lives in you all. 🏠✨🕊️
## 1 Corinthians 3:17
If anyone hurts God’s temple, God will stop that person. God’s temple is holy. You all are that temple. ⚠️✋🏠✨
## 1 Corinthians 3:18
Do not trick yourself. If you think you are very smart, be simple and learn God’s way. 🧠➡️🙂📚
## 1 Corinthians 3:19
World smart is silly to God. God stops tricky plans. 🌍🤪✋
## 1 Corinthians 3:20
The Lord knows what smart people think. Their plans are empty to Him. 👑🧠🫙
## 1 Corinthians 3:21
So do not brag about people. God gives you all you need. 🚫😤➡️🙂🎁
## 1 Corinthians 3:22
Paul, Apollos, Peter, the world, life, death, now, and later—God uses all for you. 🧑‍🏫🧑‍🏫🧔🌍🌤️⚰️📅⏳
## 1 Corinthians 3:23
You belong to Jesus. Jesus belongs to God. ✝️➡️👥➡️👑
