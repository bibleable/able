## 1 Corinthians 9:1
Paul said: I am free. I help Jesus. I saw Jesus. You are my work with Jesus. ✝️👀🧑‍🤝‍🧑
## 1 Corinthians 9:2
If some say I am not a helper, you know I am. You show my work is real in Jesus. 👍✝️
## 1 Corinthians 9:3
This is what I say to people who ask hard things about me. 🗣️
## 1 Corinthians 9:4
We can eat and drink when we work for you. 🍞🥤
## 1 Corinthians 9:5
We can have a wife who loves Jesus, like other Jesus helpers, like Jesus’ brothers, and Peter. 💍👫
## 1 Corinthians 9:6
Is it just Barnabas and me who must work to make money? 🧰💼
## 1 Corinthians 9:7
A soldier gets pay. A farmer eats fruit from his plants. A person with sheep drinks milk. 🪖🍇🐑🥛
## 1 Corinthians 9:8
This is not just my idea. God’s book says this too. 📖
## 1 Corinthians 9:9
God says, do not cover a cow’s mouth when it works. Let it eat. 🐄🌾
## 1 Corinthians 9:10
This is for us too. People who plant and cut food hope for good pay. 🌱🍎😊
## 1 Corinthians 9:11
We gave you Jesus things for your heart. Is it bad if we get food and help from you? 🍎🤝
## 1 Corinthians 9:12
Others get help from you. We could too. But we did not take it. We did not want to stop the good news. 🚫💰📣
## 1 Corinthians 9:13
People who work in God’s house get food from there. 🏠🍞
## 1 Corinthians 9:14
Jesus wants people who tell His good news to get help to live. ✝️🍽️
## 1 Corinthians 9:15
But I did not use this help. I do not want anyone to stop my joy in telling you. 😊📣
## 1 Corinthians 9:16
I must tell the good news. I have to do it. If I do not, it is bad for me. 🔥📣
## 1 Corinthians 9:17
If I want to do it, I get a gift. If I must do it, it is still my job from God. 🎁🛠️
## 1 Corinthians 9:18
My gift is this: I tell the good news for free. I do not use my right to get pay. 🆓📣
## 1 Corinthians 9:19
I am free. I choose to serve all people, to help many come to Jesus. 🤝➡️✝️
## 1 Corinthians 9:20
With Jewish people, I act like them to help them know Jesus. With rule people, I act kind to their rules to help them. 🫂📜
## 1 Corinthians 9:21
With people with no rules, I am with them too, to help them. I still obey God and Jesus. 🌍❤️✝️
## 1 Corinthians 9:22
With weak ones, I am gentle. I try many ways to save some. I want all to know Jesus. 🤗🛟✝️
## 1 Corinthians 9:23
I do this for the good news, so I can share the gift with them. 🎁📣
## 1 Corinthians 9:24
Many run in a race. One gets a prize. You all run to win for Jesus. 🏃‍♂️🏅
## 1 Corinthians 9:25
Runners train hard. They want a small prize. We want a prize that lasts forever with Jesus. 🏋️‍♂️🏆✨
## 1 Corinthians 9:26
I run with a plan. I do not fight the air. I know where to go. 🏃‍♂️👐➡️
## 1 Corinthians 9:27
I tell my body no. I make it obey. I do not want to teach and then do bad. 🚫🍰💪
