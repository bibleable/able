## 1 Corinthians 4:1
Paul said, “See us as Jesus’ helpers. We work for Him. We share God’s good things.” 🙋‍♂️✝️📖
## 1 Corinthians 4:2
God’s helpers must be true and do good work. 👍🧰
## 1 Corinthians 4:3
It is not big to me if you or people say I am bad or good. I do not judge me. 🚫⚖️🙂
## 1 Corinthians 4:4
I do not see wrong in me, but that does not make me right. The Lord will judge me. 👀➡️⚖️
## 1 Corinthians 4:5
Do not judge now. Wait for the Lord. He will show what is dark and what is in hearts. Then God will say, “Good job,” to each one. ⏳🌟❤️
## 1 Corinthians 4:6
I used me and Apollos to teach all of you: Do not go past the book. Do not pick one man and be proud. 📖🙅‍♂️💬
## 1 Corinthians 4:7
All you have is a gift. You got it from God. So do not brag. 🎁🙏🚫
## 1 Corinthians 4:8
You act like you have all you want. You act rich and like kings. I wish we were kings with you too. 👑🍞🤷‍♂️
## 1 Corinthians 4:9
God shows us, His helpers, like last, like men to die. All watch us, people and angels. 🕊️➡️⚠️👀
## 1 Corinthians 4:10
We look silly for Jesus. You look smart. We are weak. You are strong. People like you, not us. 🤡💪➡️😔
## 1 Corinthians 4:11
We are hungry and thirsty. We are in bad clothes. We are hit. We have no home. 🍞🚫🥤🚫🥶🏚️
## 1 Corinthians 4:12
We work hard with our hands. When people say bad to us, we say good. When hurt, we keep going. ✋🛠️🙂➡️💔🏃‍♂️
## 1 Corinthians 4:13
When people lie about us, we talk nice. People treat us like trash of the world. 🗣️❤️🗑️🌍
## 1 Corinthians 4:14
I do not say this to shame you. I talk like a dad to kids I love. 👨‍👧‍👦❤️
## 1 Corinthians 4:15
You have many helpers, but not many dads. In Jesus, I am like your dad. I told you the good news. 👨‍👧‍👦✝️🗞️
## 1 Corinthians 4:16
So I ask you, please copy me. 👣🙂
## 1 Corinthians 4:17
I sent Timothy, my loved and true son in the Lord. He will help you remember how I live in Jesus. I teach the same in every church. 🧑‍🦱✉️⛪
## 1 Corinthians 4:18
Some of you act big and proud. You think I will not come. 😠🗣️
## 1 Corinthians 4:19
I will come soon, if the Lord lets me. I will see what these big talk men can do, not just say. 🗓️🚶‍♂️⚡
## 1 Corinthians 4:20
God’s way is not just talk. It has power. 🕊️💥
## 1 Corinthians 4:21
What do you want? Should I come with a stick, or with love and a soft way? 🪵❓❤️🤗
