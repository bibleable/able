## 1 Corinthians 1:1
Paul writes this letter. God picked Paul to be a helper of Jesus. Sosthenes is with Paul. ✍️🙏
## 1 Corinthians 1:2
This is for God’s church in Corinth. You are God’s people in Jesus. All who call on Jesus belong to Him. ⛪🙌
## 1 Corinthians 1:3
May God our Father and the Lord Jesus be kind to you. May you have peace. 🕊️❤️
## 1 Corinthians 1:4
I thank God for you. God was very kind to you in Christ Jesus. 🙏😊
## 1 Corinthians 1:5
God helps you talk well and know many true things about Jesus. 🗣️🧠✨
## 1 Corinthians 1:6
The good news about Christ is strong and true in you. 📖✅
## 1 Corinthians 1:7
You have every gift as you wait for Jesus to come again. 🎁⏳
## 1 Corinthians 1:8
Jesus will keep you strong to the end, so no one can blame you on His big day. 💪🛡️
## 1 Corinthians 1:9
God keeps His word. He called you to be close with His Son, Jesus. 🤝💖
## 1 Corinthians 1:10
Dear friends, please agree. Do not fight. Be one family in Jesus. 🤍🧩
## 1 Corinthians 1:11
Some people from Chloe told me you all are fighting. 🗣️⚠️
## 1 Corinthians 1:12
Some of you say, “I am with Paul.” Others say, “I am with Apollos,” or “I am with Peter,” or “I am with Christ.” 🧍🧍‍♂️🧍‍♀️➡️
## 1 Corinthians 1:13
Is Christ split into parts? Did Paul die on a cross for you? Were you put in water in Paul’s name? ❓✝️🚫
## 1 Corinthians 1:14
I thank God I only put in water Crispus and Gaius. 🙏💧
## 1 Corinthians 1:15
I did this so no one can say you were put in water in my name. 🚫🏷️
## 1 Corinthians 1:16
I also put in water the family of Stephanas. I do not remember if I put in water anyone else. 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦💧
## 1 Corinthians 1:17
Christ sent me to tell the good news, not to use big fancy words, so the cross of Christ shows real power. 📣✝️⚡
## 1 Corinthians 1:18
Some people think the cross is silly. We who are saved know the cross is God’s power. 🤔✝️💥
## 1 Corinthians 1:19
God says, “I will stop the smart talk of the smart people.” ✋🧠
## 1 Corinthians 1:20
Where are the smart ones and the big talkers now? God made the world’s smart ways look silly. 🧐🤷
## 1 Corinthians 1:21
People did not find God by being smart. God uses simple good news to save people who trust Him. 🗣️➡️💖
## 1 Corinthians 1:22
Some Jews want big signs. Some Greeks want smart ideas. ✨🧠
## 1 Corinthians 1:23
We tell about Christ on the cross. Some Jews trip on this. Many non-Jews think it is silly. ✝️🧱🤷
## 1 Corinthians 1:24
But to people God calls, Jews and Greeks, Christ is God’s power and God’s wisdom. ✝️⚡🧠
## 1 Corinthians 1:25
God’s “silly” is wiser than people. God’s “weak” is stronger than people. 💡💪
## 1 Corinthians 1:26
Look at you. Not many of you are very smart, or strong, or important. 👀🙂
## 1 Corinthians 1:27
God chose people the world calls silly to show the smart are wrong. God chose weak ones to show the strong are wrong. 🔄
## 1 Corinthians 1:28
God chose people others look down on, even people no one sees, to stop the proud. 🌱👀
## 1 Corinthians 1:29
So no one can brag to God. 🚫😤
## 1 Corinthians 1:30
God put you in Christ Jesus. Jesus is our wisdom. He makes us right. He makes us clean and free. 🙌🧼🕊️
## 1 Corinthians 1:31
If you brag, brag about the Lord. Point to Him. 📣➡️🙏
