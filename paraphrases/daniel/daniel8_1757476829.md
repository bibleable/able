## Daniel 8:3
Daniel saw a ram with two horns. One horn grew later and got big. 🐏2️⃣🦴
## Daniel 8:4
The ram ran and hit to the west, north, and south. No one could stop it. 🐏💥⬅️⬆️⬇️🚫✋

The goat got very strong. Then its big horn broke. Four new horns grew to four sides. 🐐💪➡️🦴💥4️⃣🧭
## Daniel 8:9
From one horn came a small horn. It grew big to the south, to the east, and to the nice land. 🦴➡️🔸⬇️➡️🌿🏞️
## Daniel 8:10
It grew up to the sky. It threw star ones down and stepped on them. ⬆️🌌🌟⬇️👣
## Daniel 8:11
It tried to fight the Great Prince. It stopped the daily gifts to God. It hurt God’s house. ⚔️👑✋🍞🔥⛔️🏛️💔
## Daniel 8:12
People did bad sin. So the horn got to rule. It threw truth down. It won for a time. 🚫🙏➡️🔸👑📖⬇️🏆⏳
## Daniel 8:13
Two holy ones talked. One said, How long will this be? 👼👼🗣️⏱️❓

Gabriel said, The goat means the king of Greece. The big horn means the first big king. 🐐➡️👑🇬🇷 🦴➡️1️⃣👑
## Daniel 8:22
Gabriel said, The big horn broke. Four horns came. This means four new lands will come, but not as strong. 🦴💥➡️4️⃣🦴🗺️⬇️💪
## Daniel 8:23
Later, when they are almost done, a hard and mean king will rise. ⏰➡️👑😠⬆️
