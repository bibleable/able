Three times each year, all the men must come to see the Lord God. 🚶‍♂️🚶‍♂️🚶‍♂️🙏
## Exodus 23:18
Do not use yeast with My animal blood gift. Do not leave the fat from My party gift until morning. 🍞⛔️🩸⚠️

I will do it little by little, until you are many and can live there. 📈🏠
## Exodus 23:31
Your land will go from the Red Sea to the big sea, and from the desert to the big river. I will hand over the people there. You will chase them out. 🌊➡️🌊🏜️➡️🏞️
## Exodus 23:32
Do not make a deal with them or their fake gods. 🤝🚫🗿
## Exodus 23:33
Do not let them stay in your land. They will make you do bad and serve fake gods. That is a trap. 🚫🏠🗿🪤
