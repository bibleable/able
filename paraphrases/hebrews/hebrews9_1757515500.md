In there was a gold altar for sweet smoke and a gold box. The box had manna, Aaron’s stick, and the stone rules. 🟨🪙🧴🍞🌿🪨

## Hebrews 9:6
Priests went in the first room often to do God’s work. ⛪👨‍⚖️➡️

Only the big priest went in the Most Holy Room, one day each year. He took blood for his own sin and for the people. ⛺⛔🗓️1️⃣🩸

There were rules about food, drink, and washing. These were for a short time only. 🍞🥤🚿⏳
## Hebrews 9:11
But Jesus came as our High Priest of good things. He went in a better tent, not made by people. ✝️👑⛺✨
## Hebrews 9:12
He went in one time and saved us forever. He did not use animal blood. He used His own blood. 1️⃣⏱️🩸❤️
## Hebrews 9:13
Animal blood and ash could make bodies clean on the outside. 🐂🐐🔥🚿
