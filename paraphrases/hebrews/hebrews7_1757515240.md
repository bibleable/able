## Hebrews 7:1
Melchizedek was a king in a place named Salem. He was a God helper. He met Abraham after a big fight and blessed him. 👑🏙️🤝🙏
## Hebrews 7:2
Abraham gave Melchizedek one tenth of what he had. Melchizedek’s name means king of right and good, and king of peace. ✋1️⃣0️⃣🕊️
## Hebrews 7:3
We do not read his dad or mom. We do not see his start or end. He is like God’s Son. He is a God helper for ever. 📖❓♾️
## Hebrews 7:4
See how great he was! Abraham, a big man, gave him one tenth. 👀⭐✋1️⃣0️⃣
## Hebrews 7:5
Men from Levi are God helpers too. They take one tenth from the people, who are also from Abraham. 👨‍👦‍👦✋1️⃣0️⃣
## Hebrews 7:6
But Melchizedek was not from Levi. He took one tenth from Abraham and blessed him, the man God gave promises to. 🤝✋1️⃣0️⃣🙏
## Hebrews 7:7
The big one blesses the small one. That is sure. 👍➡️🙂
## Hebrews 7:8
Here, men who die take the tenth. There, it says Melchizedek lives. 🧍⏳➡️✋1️⃣0️⃣ | 🕊️📖
## Hebrews 7:9
In a way, Levi paid too, through Abraham. 🔄✋1️⃣0️⃣
## Hebrews 7:10
Levi was not born yet. He was still in Abraham when Melchizedek met him. 👶⏳🤝
## Hebrews 7:11
The old God helper way did not make all good. So we need a new God helper, like Melchizedek, not like Aaron. 🔄🙏
## Hebrews 7:12
When the God helper job changes, the rule changes too. 🔁📜
## Hebrews 7:13
The One we talk about came from a tribe that did not work at God’s table. 🚫🧍🍞
## Hebrews 7:14
It is clear. Our Lord Jesus came from Judah. Moses did not say men from Judah can be God helpers. ✝️🧬
## Hebrews 7:15
It is even more clear when a new God helper comes, like Melchizedek. 🌟🙏
## Hebrews 7:16
He is a God helper not by family law, but by His strong life that does not end. ♾️💪
## Hebrews 7:17
God says, “You are a God helper for ever, like Melchizedek.” 🗣️📖♾️
## Hebrews 7:18
The old rule was weak. It was put away. 🗑️📜
## Hebrews 7:19
The law did not make us all good. A better hope came. By this we come near to God. 💖➡️🙏
## Hebrews 7:20
All this came with God’s oath, a strong promise. 🤝🗣️
## Hebrews 7:21
Men were God helpers with no oath, but Jesus was made with God’s oath: “The Lord said, You are a God helper for ever.” God will not change His mind. ✝️🗣️♾️
## Hebrews 7:22
So Jesus makes a better deal for us with God. ✝️👍
## Hebrews 7:23
Many old God helpers were there, but they died, so there were many of them. ⚰️➡️👥
## Hebrews 7:24
But Jesus lives for ever. His God helper job stays. ✝️♾️
## Hebrews 7:25
So He can save all who come to God by Him. He lives to speak to God for them all the time. ✝️🙌🗣️🙏
## Hebrews 7:26
We need a Big God Helper like Him. He is holy. He did no wrong. He is clean. He is high in heaven. ✝️✨☁️
## Hebrews 7:27
He does not need to give gifts every day like other big God helpers. He did it once for all. He gave Himself for us. ✝️🎁✅
## Hebrews 7:28
The law picks weak men as big God helpers. But God’s oath picks the Son. He is perfect for ever. ✝️👑♾️
