## Hebrews 5:1
Every big priest is a man. He helps people talk to God. He gives gifts to God for bad things. 🙏🎁
## Hebrews 5:2
The big priest is kind to people who do not know and to people who go the wrong way, because he is weak too. 😊➡️🤷‍♀️
## Hebrews 5:3
So the big priest brings gifts for his own bad things too. 🙇‍♂️🎁
## Hebrews 5:4
No man picks this job by himself. God calls him, like God called Aaron. ☎️👆
## Hebrews 5:5
Jesus did not make Himself the big priest. God said, “You are My Son today.” ✝️💬👑
## Hebrews 5:6
God also said, “You are a priest for all time, like Melchizedek long ago.” ⏳⛪
## Hebrews 5:7
When Jesus lived as a man, He prayed loud and cried with tears to God who could save Him from death. God heard Him because He loved and obeyed. 🙏😭🕊️
## Hebrews 5:8
Jesus is God’s Son. He learned to obey by hard times. 👦💙📖
## Hebrews 5:9
After this, Jesus was ready. He saves for all time all who listen to Him and do what He says. ✝️🛟♾️👂✅
## Hebrews 5:10
God named Jesus the big priest, like Melchizedek. 👑⛪
## Hebrews 5:11
We have more to say. It is hard to tell you now, because you do not listen well. 🗣️😕👂
## Hebrews 5:12
By now you should teach. But you need someone to teach you the first easy words from God again. You need milk, not hard food. 🍼🍞🚫
## Hebrews 5:13
If you only drink milk, you are not ready to use God’s word about what is right. You are like a small child. 👶🍼📖
## Hebrews 5:14
But hard food is for big people. They train by practice. They learn to see good and bad. 🍗💪✅❌
