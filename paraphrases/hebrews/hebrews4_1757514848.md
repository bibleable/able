## Hebrews 4:1
God made a promise for us to come into His rest. Be careful. Do not miss it. 🛏️😌⚠️
## Hebrews 4:2
We heard good news too. They heard it long ago, but it did not help them, because they did not trust God. 📣👂🙏❌
## Hebrews 4:3
We who trust God go into His rest. But God said to some, “You will not go in.” God made the world long ago, and His work was done. 🛏️✅🌍⏳
## Hebrews 4:4
The book says, “God rested on day seven.” 📖7️⃣🛌
## Hebrews 4:5
God also said, “They will not go into My rest.” 🗣️🚫🛌
## Hebrews 4:6
The rest is still open now. Some did not go in because they did not obey God. 🚪🟢➡️❌
## Hebrews 4:7
God picked a day called “Today.” He said, “Today, if you hear God, do not make your heart hard.” 📅🟢👂❤️🪨
## Hebrews 4:8
If Joshua gave full rest, God would not talk about another day later. So there is more rest to come. 👤🏞️⏭️
## Hebrews 4:9
So there is still a special rest for God’s people. 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦✨🛌
## Hebrews 4:10
When we go into God’s rest, we stop our work, like God stopped His work. 🛌🛑🧰✋
## Hebrews 4:11
So let us try to go in. Do not be like the ones who did not obey God. 💪🚪➡️🙅
## Hebrews 4:12
God’s word is alive and strong. It is like a sharp blade. It shows what is inside us—what we think and feel. 📖💪🔪❤️🧠
## Hebrews 4:13
No one can hide from God. He sees all things. We must tell Him the truth. 👀🌎🚫🫣🗣️
## Hebrews 4:14
We have a big priest. He is Jesus, God’s Son. He went up to Heaven. So keep on trusting Him. ✝️👑⬆️☁️🤲
## Hebrews 4:15
Our big priest cares. He knows our weak parts. He was tested like us, but He did not do wrong. ❤️🤝😓✅
## Hebrews 4:16
So come close to God with brave hearts. God is kind. He gives God’s love and help when we need it. 🧎‍♂️➡️🙏💖🆘
