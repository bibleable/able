## Hebrews 8:1
The big point: We have a Big Priest. He is Jesus. He sits by God in heaven. ✝️👑⬆️
## Hebrews 8:2
Jesus works in God’s real tent in heaven. God made it, not people. ⛺️✨⬆️
## Hebrews 8:3
Every big priest brings gifts to God. So Jesus has a gift too. 🎁🙌
## Hebrews 8:4
If He was on earth, He would not be a priest here. Other men are priests by the old rules. 🌍📜
## Hebrews 8:5
Those priests work in a copy, like a shadow, of the real place in heaven. God told Moses, Make the tent like the plan I showed you on the mountain. 📄⛺️⛰️
## Hebrews 8:6
But Jesus has a better job. He brings us to God. He brings a better new promise from God. 👍✝️➡️🙏
## Hebrews 8:7
If the first promise worked, we would not need a new one. 1️⃣➡️2️⃣❌
## Hebrews 8:8
God saw the people did not keep it. God says, “I will make a new promise with My people, Israel and Judah.” 👀👥📜✨
## Hebrews 8:9
God says, “It will not be like the old promise I made when I took them from Egypt. They did not keep My promise. I was not happy with them.” 🚶‍♂️🇪🇬❌😞
## Hebrews 8:10
God says, “I will put My rules in their mind. I will write My rules on their heart. I will be their God. They will be My people.” 🧠❤️✍️🤝
## Hebrews 8:11
God says, “No one will need to teach a friend, ‘Know God.’ All people, big and small, will know Me.” 👧👨‍🦳📚🚫🙏
## Hebrews 8:12
God says, “I will be kind. I will forgive their bad. I will not remember their sins.” 💗🧽🗑️
## Hebrews 8:13
When God says “new,” the old promise is now old. What is old will soon go away. 🆕➡️🧓⏳
