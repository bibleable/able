## Hebrews 12:1
Many people who loved God came first. They cheer for us. Let us drop all bad stuff and run the race God gave us. 🏃‍♀️🏃‍♂️🎉
## Hebrews 12:2
Look to Jesus. He starts and makes our trust strong. For joy, He went to the cross. Now He sits by God on His big seat. ✝️😊👑
## Hebrews 12:3
Think about Jesus. Bad people were mean to Him. He kept going. Do not get tired. Do not quit. 💪😇
## Hebrews 12:4
You all have not had to bleed when you fight sin, the bad stuff. 🩸🚫
## Hebrews 12:5
Do not forget what God says: “My child, do not be mad when I teach you. Do not give up when I say stop.” 🗣️👂
## Hebrews 12:6
“God teaches the ones He loves. He helps each child He takes in.” ❤️👨‍👧‍👦
## Hebrews 12:7
Hard times are God teaching you. God treats you like His kids. Dads teach kids too. 🧑‍🏫👨‍👧
## Hebrews 12:8
If no one teaches you, then you are not true kids. God teaches all His kids. 📚👧👦
## Hebrews 12:9
We had dads on earth who taught us, and we listened. We should listen to our Father in heaven and live. 🙏🏽👂
## Hebrews 12:10
Dads teach for a short time. God teaches to help us be good and holy like Him. ⏳✨
## Hebrews 12:11
Teaching does not feel good now. It can hurt. Later it makes good and peace for the ones who learn from it. 😣➡️🕊️
## Hebrews 12:12
So, be strong! Lift weak arms and knees. 💪🦵
## Hebrews 12:13
Make your path straight, so weak legs get better, not worse. ➡️🛤️
## Hebrews 12:14
Try to live in peace with all people. Be holy. If we are not holy, we will not see God. 🕊️👀
## Hebrews 12:15
Help each other get God’s kind help. Do not let a mean root grow and make big trouble. 🌱🚫
## Hebrews 12:16
Do not do wrong like Esau. He sold his big first-son gift for one meal. 🍲😞
## Hebrews 12:17
Later Esau wanted the big gift back. He cried, but it was too late. He could not change it. 😢⏰
## Hebrews 12:18
You all did not come to a real mountain with fire and dark and storm. ⛰️🔥🌩️
## Hebrews 12:19
There was a loud horn and a strong voice. The people begged, “No more words!” 📣😣
## Hebrews 12:20
They could not bear the rules. Even an animal that touched the mountain had to die. 🐑⛰️⚠️
## Hebrews 12:21
It was so scary that Moses said, “I am shaking.” 😨
## Hebrews 12:22
But now you come to Mount Zion, to God’s city, the city in heaven, Jerusalem. So many angels are there and they are happy. ⛰️🏙️😇🎉
## Hebrews 12:23
You come to God’s big family. Their names are in heaven. You come to God, who is over all. You come to people made right. 📝💖
## Hebrews 12:24
You come to Jesus. He brings a new promise. His blood speaks better words than Abel’s blood. ✝️🩸🕊️
## Hebrews 12:25
Do not say no to the One who speaks. Long ago, people said no and did not get away. We must listen now too. 👂⚠️
## Hebrews 12:26
Long ago His voice shook the earth. Now He says, “I will shake earth and heaven again.” 🌎🌌🔊
## Hebrews 12:27
“Shake again” means things that can shake will go away. What cannot shake will stay. 🪨🛡️
## Hebrews 12:28
We get a home God rules that cannot fall. So we say, “Thank You.” We serve God in a good way, with deep respect and wow. 🏠🙏✨
## Hebrews 12:29
Our God is like fire that burns. 🔥
