## 2 Peter 3:1
Peter says: I write you again. This is my 2nd note. I want to help you remember good things. ✍️📝🧠
## 2 Peter 3:2
Remember what God’s helpers said long ago. Remember what our Lord Jesus said. Jesus’ helpers told it too. 📖⏳✝️
## 2 Peter 3:3
In the last days, mean people will come. They will make fun. They will do the bad things they want. 😠😜🚫
## 2 Peter 3:4
They say, “Where is Jesus? He said He will come. We do not see Him. The world looks the same, like at the start.” 🤔⌛🌍
## 2 Peter 3:5
They forget on purpose. Long ago God made the sky and the earth. God used water. God spoke, and it was. ☁️🌍💧🗣️
## 2 Peter 3:6
Long ago, the world got covered with water. The world was lost in a big flood. 🌊🌧️
## 2 Peter 3:7
Now God keeps the sky and earth for a day to come. Fire will come. God will say what is right. People who do bad and do not follow God will be lost. 🔥🌍⚖️
## 2 Peter 3:8
Dear friends, do not forget this. For the Lord, 1 day is like 1,000 years, and 1,000 years are like 1 day. ⏰1️⃣0️⃣0️⃣0️⃣🔁
## 2 Peter 3:9
The Lord is not slow. He waits on you all. He is patient. He wants all people to turn to God and live. He does not want any to be lost. ❤️⏳🙂🔄
## 2 Peter 3:10
The Day of the Lord will come fast, like a thief at night. The sky will roar. Sky things will burn. The earth and all we do will be seen. 🌌🌙🕵️🔥
## 2 Peter 3:11
So, since this will end, you all must live clean and good. Be God’s people. Do what is right. 🧼✨🙏
## 2 Peter 3:12
Wait and pray for God’s big day to come soon. The sky will burn. The sky things will melt. ⏳🙏🔥🌠🫠
## 2 Peter 3:13
But God said He will make a new sky and a new earth. We wait for them. There, all is right and good. 🌈🆕🌍😊
## 2 Peter 3:14
Dear friends, as you wait, try hard to live clean. Let Him see you calm and at peace. 💪🧼🕊️
## 2 Peter 3:15
Think of the Lord’s wait as a way to save us. Our brother Paul wrote this too. God gave him wise words. ⏳💖✉️🧠
## 2 Peter 3:16
Paul writes about this in his letters. Some parts are hard. Some people who do not learn twist the words. They hurt themselves. They do this with the Bible too. 📬🤔🔁🚫📖
## 2 Peter 3:17
So, dear friends, be careful. Do not go with people who do not obey. Do not fall. Stay strong with God. 🛑👣💪🙏
## 2 Peter 3:18
Grow in God’s kind gift and in knowing our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Give Him all the praise now and for ever. Amen. 🌱🎁📘✝️🙌∞
