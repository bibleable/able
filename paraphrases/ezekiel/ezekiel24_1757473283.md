## Ezekiel 24:4
Put good meat in. Leg meat and arm meat. Put in bones too. 🍖🦴
## Ezekiel 24:5
Pick the best sheep meat. Put much wood under it. Make it boil. Cook the bones. 🪵🔥🍲
## Ezekiel 24:6
Bad city! The pot is dirty with rust. Take out each piece. Do not pick by a game. ⚠️🍲

Then take the pot with no food. Put it on hot coals. Make it glow. Burn off the dirt and rust. 🍲🔥✨
## Ezekiel 24:12
But the pot is still very dirty. The rust will not go away, even with fire. 😣🍲🛑
