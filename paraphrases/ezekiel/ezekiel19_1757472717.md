## Ezekiel 19:1
God told Ezekiel to sing a sad song for the leaders of Israel. 😢🎵
## Ezekiel 19:2
Ezekiel said: Your mom is like a mom lion. She lived with lions and raised her cubs. 🦁👩‍🍼🦁
## Ezekiel 19:3
The mom lion raised one cub. He grew big and strong. He hurt people. 🦁➡️💪😟
## Ezekiel 19:4
Other groups heard about the cub. They set a trap and a net, caught him with chains, and took him to Egypt. 🪤🕸️⛓️➡️🇪🇬
## Ezekiel 19:5
The mom lion waited. Her hope was gone. She raised another cub to be strong. 😞🦁👶➡️🦁
## Ezekiel 19:6
The second cub walked with lions. He learned to catch things. He hurt people too. 🦁➡️🏃‍♂️🎯😟
## Ezekiel 19:7
He broke homes and towns. The land was empty. His loud roar scared all. 🏚️💥🌾❌🦁📢
## Ezekiel 19:8
Many groups came to fight him. They set their net and trap and caught him. 🛡️🗡️🕸️🪤
## Ezekiel 19:9
They put chains on him and put him in a cage. They took him to the king of Babylon. His roar was not heard in Israel again. ⛓️🦁🔒➡️👑🏰🔇
## Ezekiel 19:10
Your mom was like a grape vine by water. She grew big and strong with many branches for leaders. 🍇🌱💧🌳
## Ezekiel 19:11
Her strong sticks were like king sticks. She grew tall and could be seen high up. 🪵👑⬆️
## Ezekiel 19:12
But the vine was pulled up in anger, thrown down, dried by a hot wind, and fire burned her strong sticks. 🌬️🔥🍇🪵
## Ezekiel 19:13
Now the vine is in a desert, in dry ground with no water. 🏜️🚱
## Ezekiel 19:14
Fire came from one branch and burned the fruit. No strong stick is left for a king. This is a sad song. It will stay a sad song. 🔥🪵🍇🚫👑😢🎵
