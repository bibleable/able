## Joshua 20:1
God talked to Joshua. 🗣️🙏
## Joshua 20:2
God said, Tell the people to pick safe towns. If a person hurts someone by accident, that person can run to a safe town. 🏙️🏃‍♂️
## Joshua 20:3
The safe town will help the person who did not mean to hurt. The angry one who wants to hit back cannot get him there. 🛡️😟
## Joshua 20:4
The person runs to the town gate and talks to the town leaders. He tells what happened. They let him in and give him a place to stay. 🚪🗣️🤝🏠
## Joshua 20:5
If the angry one runs after him, the town will not give him up. It was not on purpose. He did not hate the person before. 🛑😠
## Joshua 20:6
He will live in the safe town. The people will meet to decide. He must stay there until the big priest, God’s helper, dies. Then he may go home again. 🏠⏳👴🕯️🏡
## Joshua 20:7
They chose these safe towns: Kedesh in Galilee in Naphtali, Shechem in the hill land of Ephraim, and Hebron (also called Kiriath Arba) in Judah. 📍🏙️🗺️
## Joshua 20:8
On the east side of the river Jordan, they chose Bezer in the desert from Reuben, Ramoth in Gilead from Gad, and Golan in Bashan from Manasseh. 🌅🏞️📍
## Joshua 20:9
These towns were for all Israel and for any visitor. If anyone hurt by accident, they could run there and be safe. They waited there until the people met to decide. 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦🤝⏳
