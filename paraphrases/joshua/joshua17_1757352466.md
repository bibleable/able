## Joshua 17:1
Manasseh, Joseph’s first son, got land; his son Machir was brave, so he got Gilead and Bashan. 🗺️💪🏞️
## Joshua 17:2
The other families of Manasseh got land too: Abiezer, Helek, Asriel, Shechem, Hepher, and Shemida. 🏡🗺️
## Joshua 17:3
Zelophehad had no sons, only girls: Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah. 👧👧👧👧👧
## Joshua 17:4
The girls went to Eleazar the priest, to Joshua, and to the leaders; they said God told Moses to give them land with their brothers, so the men gave them land. 🏛️🗣️🗺️
## Joshua 17:5
So Manasseh got ten parts of land, plus Gilead and Bashan over the river. 🔟🗺️🌊
## Joshua 17:6
The girls of Manasseh got land with the sons; the rest got Gilead. 👧🧑🗺️
## Joshua 17:7
The line for Manasseh went from Asher to a place by Shechem, then down to En-tappuah. 🗺️⬇️
## Joshua 17:8
Manasseh owned the land of Tappuah, but the town on the line was for Ephraim. 🏘️↔️
## Joshua 17:9
The line went to the Kanah stream; the south side was for Ephraim, the north side was for Manasseh; the sea was the end; they met Asher in the north and Issachar in the east. 🗺️🏞️🌊
## Joshua 17:10
Ephraim was on the south; Manasseh was on the north; the sea was the end; they also touched Asher on the north and Issachar on the east. 🧭🌊
## Joshua 17:11
Manasseh also had towns in Issachar and Asher: Beth-shean, Ibleam, Dor, Endor, Taanach, Megiddo, and many small towns. 🏘️⛰️
## Joshua 17:12
But the people of Manasseh could not take those towns; the Canaanites stayed there. 🚫🏘️
## Joshua 17:13
Later Israel grew strong and made the Canaanites work, but they did not push them out. 💪🧱
## Joshua 17:14
The people of Joseph said to Joshua, “Why did you give us only one share? We are many.” 🗣️❓
## Joshua 17:15
Joshua said, “If you are many, go to the big trees and cut a place in the hill land, where the Perizzites and Rephaim live, since your hill is small.” 🌳🪓⛰️
## Joshua 17:16
The people of Joseph said, “The hill is not enough; in the flat land the Canaanites have iron carts, in Beth-shean and in the Jezreel valley.” 🛞🛡️
## Joshua 17:17
Joshua said to Ephraim and Manasseh, “You are many and strong; you will not have just one share.” 💪🙂
## Joshua 17:18
“The hill land will be yours; it has trees, but you will cut them and take the land far and wide; you will drive out the Canaanites, even with iron carts and strong men.” 🌳🪓🏞️🛞
