## Romans 11:1
Paul says, “Did God say no to His people?” No! I am from Israel. I am from Abraham’s big family. I am from Benjamin. 🙋‍♂️🇮🇱✨
## Romans 11:2
God did not say no to His first people. Long ago, Elijah talked to God about Israel. 🙏🇮🇱
## Romans 11:3
Elijah said, “They hurt Your helpers. They broke Your places to pray. I am alone. They want to hurt me.” 😢🏚️
## Romans 11:4
God said to Elijah, “I kept 7,000 people. They did not bow to a fake god.” 🙌7️⃣0️⃣0️⃣0️⃣
## Romans 11:5
So now, some people are left for God. God chose them because He is kind. 🌟❤️
## Romans 11:6
If God chose by being kind, then it is not by our work. If it is by work, it is not by kind gift. 🎁🚫💼
## Romans 11:7
Most in Israel did not get what they wanted. The ones God chose did. The rest got hard hearts. 💔
## Romans 11:8
It says: God let them be sleepy. Eyes did not see. Ears did not hear. It is still like this. 😴🙈🙉
## Romans 11:9
David said: Their table became a trap. It made them fall. 🍽️🪤
## Romans 11:10
Their eyes got dark. Their backs bent all the time. 🌑😣
## Romans 11:11
Paul says, “Did they fall and never get up?” No! When they did wrong, other people got saved. This makes Israel want God too. ✝️🌍➡️🇮🇱
## Romans 11:12
If their wrong gave good things to the world, how much more good when they come back! ➕✨
## Romans 11:13
Paul talks to other people: “God sent me to you. I am happy to help you.” 🗣️🌍😊
## Romans 11:14
“I hope my own people see and want God. I hope some will be saved.” 🇮🇱👀❤️
## Romans 11:15
If their “no” helped the world be friends with God, their “yes” will be like life from the dead. 🌎🤝✨
## Romans 11:16
If the first part is clean and special for God, the rest is too. If the root is clean and special for God, the branches are too. 🌱🌿
## Romans 11:17
Some branches were cut off. You, a wild branch, were put in. Now you share the good food from the root. 🌿✂️➡️🌳
## Romans 11:18
Do not brag to the old branches. You do not hold the root. The root holds you. 🙅‍♂️🌳
## Romans 11:19
You may say, “Branches were cut off so I could be put in.” 💭🌿
## Romans 11:20
Yes, but they were cut off because they did not trust God. You stand because you trust. Do not be proud. Be careful. 🙏⚠️
## Romans 11:21
If God did not let the first branches stay when they did not trust, He may not let you stay if you turn away. ✂️🌿
## Romans 11:22
See both: God is kind, and God is strict. He was strict to the ones who fell. He is kind to you if you stay with His kind way. If not, you will be cut off too. 😊⚖️
## Romans 11:23
And they can be put in again if they stop not-trusting. God can put them in again. 🔁🌿
## Romans 11:24
You were cut from a wild tree and put into a good tree. If God did that for you, He can put the real branches back in their own tree. 🌳🔁
## Romans 11:25
I do not want you to think you are wise. Part of Israel is hard now, until many other people come in. 🧠🚫⏳
## Romans 11:26
Then many in Israel will be saved. It says: The Saver will come from Zion. He will take away bad from Jacob. 🛟⛰️
## Romans 11:27
God says: This is My promise to them. I will take away their bad. 📜❤️
## Romans 11:28
Now, about the good news, they fight it, so you can get it. But God still loves them because of their fathers. 📖❤️
## Romans 11:29
God does not take back His gifts and His call. 🎁🔒
## Romans 11:30
You did not obey before. Now God was kind to you because they did not obey. 🔄❤️
## Romans 11:31
Now they do not obey. Soon they can get mercy too, because God was kind to you. 🤝❤️
## Romans 11:32
God let all do wrong, so He can show mercy to all. 🌍❤️
## Romans 11:33
Wow! God is so rich in wisdom and know-how. We cannot see all His ways. 😮✨
## Romans 11:34
Who knows God’s mind? Who can tell God what to do? 🤔❓
## Romans 11:35
Who gave to God first, so God must pay back? No one. 🙅‍♂️🎁
## Romans 11:36
All things come from Him, by Him, and for Him. Give Him praise forever. Amen. 🌟🙌
