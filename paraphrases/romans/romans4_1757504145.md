## Romans 4:1
Paul says, “What did Abraham, our big family dad, find?” 🤔👴
## Romans 4:2
If Abraham was made right by what he did, he could brag. But not to God. 😎🙅‍♂️
## Romans 4:3
The book says, “Abraham trusted God. God said he was right.” 📖🙏✅
## Romans 4:4
If you work, your pay is not a gift. It is what you earn. 👷💰➡️🧾
## Romans 4:5
But if you do not work and you trust God who makes bad people right, God says you are right. 🙏➡️✅
## Romans 4:6
David says this too: Happy is the one God calls right, not by work. 🎵😊
## Romans 4:7
Happy are the ones God forgives. Their bad things are covered. 😊🧼
## Romans 4:8
Happy is the one God will not count bad things. 😊🙅‍♂️🧮
## Romans 4:9
Is this happy gift only for the body sign group, or for all? We say Abraham was called right by trust. ❓👥🎁✅
## Romans 4:10
When did God call him right? Before the body sign, or after? Before. ⏰⬅️✅
## Romans 4:11
He got a body sign. The sign showed he was right by trust when he had no sign. So he is dad of all who trust with no sign. God will call them right too. 🚩🙏👨‍👩‍👧‍👦✅
## Romans 4:12
He is also dad of the sign group who walk in his trust steps. 👣👪🙏
## Romans 4:13
God gave a big promise to Abraham and his kids: He would get the world. Not by rules, but by trust. 🌍🎁📜❌🙏
## Romans 4:14
If only rule keepers get it, then trust is nothing, and the promise is gone. 📜➡️🚫🙏💨
## Romans 4:15
Rules bring anger. If there is no rule, you cannot break it. 📜😠🚫
## Romans 4:16
So the promise comes by trust. This kind gift is sure for all his kids. Not only the rule group, but all who trust like Abraham. He is dad of us all. 🎁✅👨‍👩‍👧‍👦🙏
## Romans 4:17
God said, “I made you dad of many families.” Abraham stood before God. He trusted God. God makes dead live. God makes things from nothing. 🗣️👨‍👩‍👧‍👦⚰️➡️🌱✨
## Romans 4:18
He hoped and trusted, even when it was hard. He would be dad of many families, like God said, “So many kids.” 🌟🙏👶👶👶
## Romans 4:19
He did not give up. He was very old. Sarah could not have a baby. But he still trusted. 👴👵🚫👶🙏
## Romans 4:20
He did not stop. He grew strong in trust and said, “God is big!” 💪🙏🙌
## Romans 4:21
He was sure God can do what He said. ✅🗣️🏁
## Romans 4:22
So God said he was right, because he trusted. ✅🙏
## Romans 4:23
These words, “God said he was right,” were not only for him. 📝➡️👤➕👥
## Romans 4:24
They are for us too. God will say we are right if we trust Him who made Jesus our Lord alive again. 🙋‍♀️🙋‍♂️✅🙏✝️🪦➡️🌅
## Romans 4:25
Jesus died for our bad things. God made Him alive to make us right with God. ✝️😢➡️🪦🌅😊✅
