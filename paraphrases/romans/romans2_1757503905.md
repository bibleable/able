## Romans 2:1
Paul says: You who say, “You are bad,” have no excuse. You do wrong too. When you point at them, you point at you. 👉⚖️
## Romans 2:2
God judges right. He knows the truth. He will judge people who do wrong. ⚖️👀
## Romans 2:3
You who judge others, do you think you can get away? No. God will judge you too. 😮⚖️
## Romans 2:4
Do not step on God’s kind love. God is kind. He waits. He is patient. His kind love helps you stop wrong and turn back. ❤️⏳🔄
## Romans 2:5
Your hard heart will not turn. You pile up God’s anger for the day God judges. God is fair. 💔🔥⚖️
## Romans 2:6
God will pay each one for what they do. 🧾⚖️
## Romans 2:7
People who keep doing good and do not give up will get life that never ends. 😊🏅♾️
## Romans 2:8
But people who say, “I want my way,” and do not obey truth will have trouble and pain. 😠🔥
## Romans 2:9
All who do wrong will have a hard time and feel tight inside. Jews first, then other people. 😣⛔
## Romans 2:10
All who do good will have praise and peace. Jews first, then others. 😊🕊️
## Romans 2:11
God is fair to all. God does not pick one side. ⚖️🤝
## Romans 2:12
People who do wrong and do not know God’s rules will still be punished. People who do wrong and know God’s rules will be judged by those rules. 📜⚖️
## Romans 2:13
It is not enough to hear God’s rules. You must do them. 👂❌➡️✅
## Romans 2:14
People who are not Jews do not have God’s rules, but sometimes they do what is right anyway. This shows the rule is inside them. 🙂❤️
## Romans 2:15
Their hearts say, “Do right.” Their own thoughts tell them when they do wrong or right. ❤️🧠☝️
## Romans 2:16
One day God will judge even secret things. He will do this by Jesus. 📅🔍✝️
## Romans 2:17
You say, “I am a Jew.” You rest on God’s rules. You say, “I know God.” 🗣️📜🙏
## Romans 2:18
You say you know what God wants. You say, “This is good.” You learned from God’s rules. 👍📖
## Romans 2:19
You think, “I can lead people who cannot see. I am a light for people in dark.” 🕯️👣
## Romans 2:20
You think, “I teach people. I teach kids. I have truth in God’s rules.” 🧑‍🏫📘
## Romans 2:21
But you who teach, do you teach you? You say, “Do not steal,” but do you steal? 🤔👜
## Romans 2:22
You say, “Do not cheat on your wife or husband.” But do you cheat? You say, “Do not love fake gods.” But do you steal from God’s house? ❓💔🏠
## Romans 2:23
You say, “I am good with God’s rules.” But you break them and make God look bad. 😞
## Romans 2:24
Long ago it was written: People who are not Jews say bad things about God because of you. 😢🗣️
## Romans 2:25
The mark on the body for God’s people helps if you obey God’s rules. But if you break the rules, that mark means nothing. 🏷️➡️🚫
## Romans 2:26
If a man with no mark does what God says, God will see him like a man with the mark. 👨✅👀
## Romans 2:27
Then the man with no mark, who does obey, will show you are wrong, you who have the rules and the mark but do not obey. ☝️⚖️
## Romans 2:28
You are not God’s true person just on the outside. The mark on the body is not the main thing. 🚫👕➡️❤️
## Romans 2:29
God’s true person is one on the inside. The real mark is on the heart. God’s Holy Spirit does it, not just words on a page. Praise comes from God, not from people. 🙏❤️🕊️
