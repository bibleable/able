## 2 Kings 17:1
Hoshea, son of Elah, became king of Israel in the city Samaria. He was king for nine years while Ahaz was king in Judah. 👑🏙️
## 2 Kings 17:2
Hoshea did bad to God, but not as bad as the kings before him. 🚫🙏
## 2 Kings 17:3
A big king from Assyria came. Hoshea had to send him gifts each year. 🎁👑
## 2 Kings 17:4
Hoshea asked a king in Egypt for help and stopped the gifts. The Assyria king caught him and put him in jail. 📨🧭🔒
## 2 Kings 17:5
The Assyria king came to the land and camped by Samaria for three years. ⛺🏙️⏳
## 2 Kings 17:6
In year nine, the king took the city. He took the people to Assyria, to Halah, Habor, Gozan, and towns of the Medes. 🏹➡️🧳
## 2 Kings 17:7
This happened because the people did bad to God. God saved them from Egypt, but they prayed to fake gods. 🛶➡️🏞️🙏❌
## 2 Kings 17:8
They did the same bad ways as other lands. 🌍⚠️
## 2 Kings 17:9
The people did secret bad things. They made tall places to pray to fake gods in many towns. 🏔️🪧
## 2 Kings 17:10
They put up stone things and wood poles. They prayed to fake gods on hills and under trees. 🗿🪵🌳
## 2 Kings 17:11
They burned sweet smoke to fake gods and did many bad things. God was angry. 🔥🌀
## 2 Kings 17:12
They bowed to fake gods. God had said, do not do that. 🙇❌
## 2 Kings 17:13
God sent His helpers to say, “Stop bad ways. Obey God. Keep His rules like long ago.” 📣📜
## 2 Kings 17:14
They would not listen. They were hard and would not change, like their dads. 🙉🚫
## 2 Kings 17:15
They said no to God’s rules and God’s promise. They forgot God’s big help. They ran after fake gods that are nothing, and became like nothing. 🏃‍♂️➡️❌
## 2 Kings 17:16
They left God’s rules. They made two calf statues and a tall wood pole. They bowed to the stars and served a fake god named Baal. 🐮🐮🪵✨
## 2 Kings 17:17
They burned their boys and girls in fire. They used magic. They chose very bad things. 🔥👦👧🪄
## 2 Kings 17:18
God was very angry. He sent the people away. Only Judah stayed. ⚖️➡️
## 2 Kings 17:19
But Judah did not obey God too. They did the same bad ways as Israel. 🔄🚫
## 2 Kings 17:20
God said no to Israel. He let enemies hurt them and take their things. He sent them out. 🛡️⚔️➡️
## 2 Kings 17:21
Long ago, Israel split from King David’s house. They made Jeroboam king. He led them away from God. He made them do big sins. 🔀👑
## 2 Kings 17:22
The people kept doing the bad things Jeroboam did. They would not stop. 🔁🚫
## 2 Kings 17:23
So God sent Israel away, just like His messengers said. Israel was taken to Assyria and stayed there. 📣➡️🧳
## 2 Kings 17:24
The Assyria king brought new people from far lands to live in Samaria. They lived in the towns. 🧍🧍‍♀️🧍‍♂️🏠
## 2 Kings 17:25
At first, they did not obey God. God sent lions. The lions hurt some people. 🦁⚠️
## 2 Kings 17:26
They told the king, “The new people do not know the God of this land. Lions came.” 🗣️🦁
## 2 Kings 17:27
The king said, “Send a God helper man back to teach them how to obey the God of the land.” 📩👨‍🦳📖
## 2 Kings 17:28
A God helper came back and lived in Bethel. He taught the people to obey God. 🏠📚
## 2 Kings 17:29
But each group still made its own fake gods and put them on high places. 🗿⬆️
## 2 Kings 17:30
People from Babylon made a fake god. People from Cuthah made Nergal. People from Hamath made Ashima. 🗿🗿🗿
## 2 Kings 17:31
People from Avva made Nibhaz and Tartak. People from Sepharvaim even burned their kids for fake gods named Adrammelech and Anammelech. 🔥👶❌
## 2 Kings 17:32
They tried to obey God too, but they picked their own god men for the high places, and they made fires there. 🧎🔥
## 2 Kings 17:33
They obeyed God and also served their own fake gods. They did both. ➕➖
## 2 Kings 17:34
For a long time, they kept old ways. They did not fully obey God. They did not keep the rules God gave to Jacob, who is also called Israel. ⏳📜
## 2 Kings 17:35
God made a promise with them. He said, “Do not fear other gods. Do not bow down. Do not serve them. Do not make fires for them.” 🤝❌🗿
## 2 Kings 17:36
God saved you from Egypt with His strong hand. Obey only God. Bow to Him and bring gifts to Him. 💪🛶🙏
## 2 Kings 17:37
Keep God’s rules every day. Do not fear other gods. 📜✅
## 2 Kings 17:38
Do not forget God’s promise with you. Do not fear other gods. 🧠🤝
## 2 Kings 17:39
Obey only God, and He will save you from all your enemies. 🛡️🙌
## 2 Kings 17:40
But they did not listen. They kept the old bad ways. 🙉🔁
## 2 Kings 17:41
So the new people obeyed God a little, and also kept fake gods. Their kids did the same. 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦🗿
