## Hosea 8:1
God said, “Blow a horn!” An enemy comes fast, like a big bird, to God’s house, because the people broke God’s rules. 🎺🦅🏠⚠️
## Hosea 8:2
The people say, “My God, we know You!” 🗣️🙏
## Hosea 8:3
But they threw away good. Bad men will chase them. 🚫👍🏃‍♂️
## Hosea 8:4
They pick kings, not from God. They pick bosses God did not pick. They use silver and gold to make fake gods. This will hurt them. 👑💰🗿
## Hosea 8:5
Samaria made a calf god. It will fail them. God is mad. How long till they stop the bad? 🐮❌
## Hosea 8:6
A man made that calf. It is not God. The calf will break. 🧑‍🔧🐮🔨
## Hosea 8:7
They plant wind, so they get a big storm. Crops will not grow. If food comes, strangers will take it. 🌬️🌪️🌾🍽️
## Hosea 8:8
Israel will be taken. They will be with other nations. They will be like a broken pot no one wants. 🧳🌍🫙💔
## Hosea 8:9
They ran to Assyria. Like a wild donkey all alone. Ephraim paid for fake friends. 🏃‍♂️➡️🗺️🐴💸
## Hosea 8:10
They paid other lands, but God will bring them back. A strong king will make them work hard and be sad. 🧑‍🤝‍🧑🔙👑😔
## Hosea 8:11
Ephraim made many altars. They use them to do more sin. ⛺⬆️❌
## Hosea 8:12
God gave many rules, but they say, “These rules are strange to us.” 📖⚠️
## Hosea 8:13
They kill animals and eat the meat at the altar, but God does not say yes. God sees their sin. They will be in big trouble. They will go to Egypt. 🐑🍖⛔➡️🇪🇬
## Hosea 8:14
Israel forgot God who made them. They built big houses for fake gods. Judah made many strong towns. God will send fire on the towns. The big houses will burn. 🧱🏙️🔥
