God said, “Ask the priests about this rule.” ❓⛪

“If someone holds special-for-God meat in his coat, and the coat touches bread, soup, wine, oil, or food, does that food become special for God?” The priests said, “No.” 🍖🧥🍞🍲🍷🛢️

“If a person touched a dead body and is dirty, and then touches food, does the food become dirty?” The priests said, “Yes.” ☠️🤲🍞
