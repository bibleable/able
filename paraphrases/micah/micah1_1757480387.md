## Micah 1:1
Micah was a man from a town. God gave Micah a message. It was in the time of three kings of Judah. The message was about Samaria and Jerusalem. 📜👂👑🏙️
## Micah 1:2
Micah said: All people, listen. God sees from His home in heaven. 👂🌍⛅
## Micah 1:3
God is coming down. He will step on the high hills. ☁️⬇️⛰️
## Micah 1:4
The hills will melt like wax by fire. The land will run like water down a hill. 🏔️🔥🕯️💧
## Micah 1:5
This is because people did wrong. In the north, Samaria led the wrong. In the south, Jerusalem led the wrong. ⚠️🚫🏙️
## Micah 1:6
God says: I will break Samaria. It will be like a field. Rocks will fall down the hill. 🧱💥🌾⬇️
## Micah 1:7
The fake god statues will be smashed. The bad money will burn. The fake gods will be gone. 🗿💥🔥
## Micah 1:8
Micah said: I will cry loud. I will take off my nice clothes. I will cry like wild dogs and big birds. 😭🧥➡️❌🐺🐦
## Micah 1:9
The hurt is very bad. The bad has spread to Judah. It came to the gate of Jerusalem. 🤕➡️🏰
## Micah 1:10
Do not tell the bad news in the far town. Cry in your own town. Sit in dust. 🤫😢🧎‍♀️🟤
## Micah 1:11
People in one town will leave in shame. People in the next town will not come out. A helper town will not help. 🚶‍♀️😔🚪🔒🙅‍♂️
## Micah 1:12
One town waits for good, but bad comes. The hard time comes from God to the gate of Jerusalem. ⏳🙂➡️😢🏰
## Micah 1:13
People in a big town, get your horses and carts. You started a bad way. You did wrong. 🐎🛞⚠️
## Micah 1:14

God says: An enemy will come to another town. The leaders will run to a cave. ⚔️🏃‍♂️🕳️
## Micah 1:16
Shave your head to show you are sad for your kids. Your kids will be taken far away. ✂️🧑‍🦲😭👶➡️🌍
