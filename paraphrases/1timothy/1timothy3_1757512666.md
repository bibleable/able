## 1 Timothy 3:1
Paul says: This is true. If a man wants to be a church leader, he wants a good work. ⛪⭐💪
## 1 Timothy 3:2
So the church leader must be very good. He has one wife. He thinks clear and stays calm. He is neat and kind. He opens his home to guests. He can teach. 👍💍🧠😌🧼🤝🏠📖
## 1 Timothy 3:3
He is not a drunk. He is not a fighter. He is gentle. He does not fight with words. He does not love money. 🚫🍷🚫🥊🙂🕊️💬❌💰
## 1 Timothy 3:4
He leads his home well. His kids obey with respect. 🏠👨‍👩‍👧‍👦✅🙏
## 1 Timothy 3:5
If a man can not lead his own home, how can he care for God’s church? ❓🏠➡️⛪
## 1 Timothy 3:6
He must not be new to the faith. If he is new, he may get a big head and fall. The devil will like that. 🚫🆕🙏😕⬇️😈
## 1 Timothy 3:7
He must be known as good by people outside the church. Then he will not fall into a trap of the devil. 🙂👥⛪➡️🚫🪤😈
## 1 Timothy 3:8
Church helpers must be good too. They do not say one thing and then another. They do not drink too much. They do not want money in a bad way. ⛪🧑‍🤝‍🧑👍🗣️↔️🚫🍷💸❌
## 1 Timothy 3:9
They keep the true news of Jesus in their hearts. They stay clean inside. ❤️📖✝️🧼
## 1 Timothy 3:10
Test them first. If they show they are good, then let them help. 🧪⏳✅🤝
## 1 Timothy 3:11
The women who help must be good too. They do not talk in a mean way. They are calm. They tell the truth. 👩‍🦰🤝👍🚫🗣️😠😌✔️
## 1 Timothy 3:12
A church helper must have one wife. He must lead his kids and home well. ⛪🤝💍👨‍👩‍👧‍👦🏠✅
## 1 Timothy 3:13
If helpers do well, people will respect them. They will feel brave to talk about trust in Christ Jesus. 🏅🙂👥🗣️✝️💬💪
## 1 Timothy 3:14
I, Paul, write these things to you, Timothy. I hope I can come to you soon. 📝➡️👦⏳💭🙂
## 1 Timothy 3:15
If I am slow, you will know how to act in God’s family, the church of the God who is alive. The church holds up the true word. 🐢⏱️👨‍👩‍👧‍👦⛪📖🧱⬆️
## 1 Timothy 3:16
This is a big true thing about Jesus: He came as a man. God’s Holy Spirit said He is right. Angels saw Him. People told about Him in many lands. Many in the world believed in Him. He went up to heaven in great light. ✨👶🕊️👼🗺️🗣️🌍✅⬆️🌟
