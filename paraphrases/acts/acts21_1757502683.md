What should we do? The people will hear you are here. 🤔
## Acts 21:23
Do what we say. We have four men with a promise to God. ✋4️⃣
## Acts 21:24
Go with these men. Make yourself clean with them. Pay for them, so they can shave their heads. Then all will know the bad talk is not true. They will see you keep the law. 🚿💈💵
## Acts 21:25
But people who are not Jews who trust Jesus must do this: do not eat food for idols, or blood, or meat from choked animals, and do not do wrong with their bodies. 🍖❌

Paul took the men. Next day he made himself clean with them. He went to the temple. He told when the days would end and gifts would be given for each man. 🕍📅🎁
