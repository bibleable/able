## 1 Timothy 5:1
Paul told Timothy: Do not be hard on an old man. Talk nice, like to a dad. 👴❤️
## 1 Timothy 5:2
Paul told Timothy: Treat old women like moms. Treat young women like sisters. Keep your heart clean. 👵👧💖
## 1 Timothy 5:3
Paul said: Help women with no husband who are truly alone. 🤲👩
## 1 Timothy 5:4
If she has kids or grandkids, they should help her at home first. This makes God glad. 🏠👧👦🙂
## 1 Timothy 5:5
A woman alone trusts God. She prays day and night. 🙏🌙☀️
## 1 Timothy 5:6
But if she only wants fun and does bad, this is not good. She is like dead inside. 🎉❌
## 1 Timothy 5:7
Teach these rules so people do not do wrong. 📣✅
## 1 Timothy 5:8
If a man will not care for his own family, he does very wrong. 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦❌
## 1 Timothy 5:9
Put a woman on the help list only if she is 60 or more and was true to one man. 📝6️⃣0️⃣
## 1 Timothy 5:10
She should have done many good things: raised kids, was kind to guests, helped God’s people, and helped sick or sad ones. 🌟👶🏽🏠🤝
## 1 Timothy 5:11
Do not put young women with no husband on the list, because they may want to marry again later. 👩‍🦰❌💍
## 1 Timothy 5:12
Then they would break their first promise. 📝💔
## 1 Timothy 5:13
They may waste time, go house to house, talk too much, and say wrong things. 🚶‍♀️🏠🗣️❌
## 1 Timothy 5:14
So I think young women should marry, have kids, care for the home, and do good so no one can say bad things. 🏡👶🙂
## 1 Timothy 5:15
Some have gone the wrong way with Satan. ⚠️😈
## 1 Timothy 5:16
If a believer has a woman with no husband in the family, they should help her. Then the church can help the ones who are all alone. 👪🤲⛪
## 1 Timothy 5:17
Church leaders who do good work should get extra thanks, most of all the ones who teach God’s word. ⛪👨‍🏫🌟
## 1 Timothy 5:18
God’s book says: Do not stop an ox from eating when it works. A worker should get pay. 📖🐂🍽️💰
## 1 Timothy 5:19
Do not listen to a blame story about a leader unless two or three people saw it. 👂🚫2️⃣3️⃣
## 1 Timothy 5:20
If someone keeps doing wrong, tell it to all, so others learn and stop. ✋📣
## 1 Timothy 5:21
I tell you before God and Jesus and His angels: do these rules the same for all. Do not pick favorites. 🙏✝️😇⚖️
## 1 Timothy 5:22
Do not choose leaders too fast. Do not join in sins. Keep yourself clean. ✋⛪🧼
## 1 Timothy 5:23
Do not drink only water. Use a little wine to help your tummy when you are sick a lot. 🚰➡️🍷🤒
## 1 Timothy 5:24
Some sins are easy to see now. Some sins show up later. 👀🕒
## 1 Timothy 5:25
Good works are seen too. If not now, they will be seen later. 🔦🌟
