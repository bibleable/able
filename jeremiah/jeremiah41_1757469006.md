It was month seven. Ishmael, son of Nethaniah, and 10 men went to see Gedaliah son of Ahikam at Mizpah. They ate food with him. 🍞🤝
## Jeremiah 41:2
Ishmael and the 10 men stood up and killed Gedaliah, the big boss the king of Babylon had made. ⚔️😢

On day two, no one knew what Ishmael did yet. ⏰😐
## Jeremiah 41:5
80 men came from Shechem, Shiloh, and Samaria. They were very sad. Their hair was cut. Their clothes were torn. They brought grain and sweet smoke for God’s house. 🙇‍♂️💔✂️👕🌾💨⛪
## Jeremiah 41:6
Ishmael ran out to meet them. He cried and said, “Come see Gedaliah.” He told a lie. 😢🏃‍♂️🗣️
## Jeremiah 41:7
They went into the city. Then Ishmael and his men killed them and threw them in a big hole. 🏙️🗡️🕳️
## Jeremiah 41:8
But 10 men said, “Do not kill us. We have food, oil, and honey in a field.” So Ishmael did not kill those 10. ✋🍞🛢️🍯🌾

The big hole was made long ago by King Asa for a fight with King Baasha. Ishmael filled the hole with many who died. 🕳️👑⏳☠️
## Jeremiah 41:10
Ishmael took the rest of the people at Mizpah. He took the king’s girls and all the people. The boss guard Nebuzaradan had left them with Gedaliah. Ishmael started to take them to the land of Ammon. 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦👧👑➡️🏜️
