God says: But My people keep going the wrong way. They do not come back to Me. They like lies. 🚶‍♂️➡️❌
## Jeremiah 8:6
God says: I listened, but no one said, “I did wrong.” No one said, “I am sorry.” Each one ran to do bad, like a horse in war. 👂🐎

## Jeremiah 8:8
You say, “We are wise. We have God’s rules.” But men who write made lies with the pen. ✍️📜❌
## Jeremiah 8:9
The “wise” will feel bad and be caught. They said no to God’s word. So they are not wise. 😞📖
