The king’s helpers said, “Find many pretty young women for the king.” 🧑‍🤝‍🧑👑

Send men to all lands. Bring the pretty girls to the king’s house. Put them in the women house. Hegai, the king’s helper, will care for them. Give them care and baths. 🏠🛁

Hegai liked Esther. He was kind fast. He gave her good food and seven helper girls. He put her in the best room. 😊🍞🛏️
## Esther 2:10
Esther did not say she was a Jew. Mordecai told her not to say it. 🤫
## Esther 2:11
Each day Mordecai walked by the women house. He asked, “Is Esther okay?” 🚶‍♂️❓
## Esther 2:12
The girls waited one year. They had baths and oils. Then each girl went to see the king. 🗓️🛁
## Esther 2:13
Each girl could take what she wanted to the king. 🎁
## Esther 2:14
She went at night and came back in the morning to a second women house with guard Shaashgaz. She could not see the king again unless he called her by name. 🌙➡️🌅

## Esther 2:20
Esther still did not say she was a Jew. She obeyed Mordecai, like before. 🤐
## Esther 2:21
Two gate guards, Bigthan and Teresh, were mad. They made a bad plan to hurt the king. Mordecai was at the gate. 😠🤫
