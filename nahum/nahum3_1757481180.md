## Nahum 3:1
God says Nineveh is a bad city. It lies, it steals, it hurts. It does not stop. ⚠️🏙️😢
## Nahum 3:2
We hear whips crack. Wheels go clack. Horses run fast. War carts jump. 🐎🛞⚔️
## Nahum 3:3
Soldiers hold a sharp sword and a spear. Many fall, and many are dead. ⚔️😟
## Nahum 3:4
This is because Nineveh did many bad tricks. It used bad magic and fooled many towns. 🧙‍♀️🚫
## Nahum 3:5
God says, “I am against you. I will show your shame to all.” ⛔👀
## Nahum 3:6
God says He will throw dirty stuff on you. All will think you are gross. 🤢
## Nahum 3:7
All who see you will run away. They will say, “Nineveh is broken.” No one will help. 🏚️🏃‍♀️
## Nahum 3:8
Are you better than big city Thebes by the big river? Water was like a wall for it. 🌊🏙️
## Nahum 3:9
Thebes had help from Egypt and Ethiopia. Put and Libya helped too. 🤝🌍
## Nahum 3:10
But Thebes fell. People were taken away. Kids were hurt. Leaders were tied and picked by lots. 😢⛓️
## Nahum 3:11
Nineveh, you will be weak like a drunk. You will hide. You will look for a safe place. 🍷🙈
## Nahum 3:12
Your forts will be like soft figs. Shake them, and they fall to the eater. 🍇👇
## Nahum 3:13
Your men will be weak. Your gates will open wide to the enemy. Fire will burn the bars. 🚪🔥
## Nahum 3:14
Go get water for the fight. Make your wall strong. Use clay. Make bricks. Work the brick oven. 💧🧱🔥
## Nahum 3:15
But fire will still eat you there. The sword will cut you. Be many like locust bugs; it will not help. 🔥⚔️🪲
## Nahum 3:16
You had many sellers, like stars. But the locust bugs will take and fly away. ✨🪲💨
## Nahum 3:17
Your leaders are like locusts. They sit in the cold. When the sun comes, they fly away. No one sees them then. 🌤️🪲
## Nahum 3:18
King of Assyria, your shepherds sleep. Your big men rest. Your people are spread on the hills. No one gathers them. 👑😴⛰️
## Nahum 3:19
Your hurt has no heal. Your wound is very bad. All who hear will clap, because you hurt them all. 💔👏
