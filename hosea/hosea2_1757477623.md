## Hosea 2:2
God says: Tell your mom to stop. She did not stay My wife. I am not her man now. Tell her to stop being not true. ✋💔

If she will not stop, I will take her good things. She will be like a dry land with no water. 🌵🚱
## Hosea 2:4
I will not help her kids now, for they did wrong with her. 🚫👧👦
## Hosea 2:5
The mom ran to fake gods. She said, “I will run to them. They give me food, water, clothes, oil, and drink.” 🏃‍♀️🛐🍞💧👗🛢️
## Hosea 2:6
So I will block her path with sharp bush. She will not find the way. 🚧🌵
## Hosea 2:7
She will run after them but not get them. She will look but not find. Then she will say, “I will go back to my first husband. It was better then.” 🏃‍♀️❌🔎➡️🏠
## Hosea 2:8
She did not see I gave her food, drink, oil, silver, and gold. She used them for fake gods. 🍞🥤🛢️💰➡️🛐

## Hosea 2:10
I will show her wrong to all. No one will save her. 👀⚠️
## Hosea 2:11
I will stop her happy days and big parties and rest days. 🎉⛔
## Hosea 2:12
I will ruin her farms and fruit trees. Wild things will eat there. 🌳🍇🦊
## Hosea 2:13
I will punish her for burning gifts to fake gods. She put on rings and jewelry. She ran after them and forgot Me. 🔥🛐💍🚶‍♀️❌
## Hosea 2:14
But I will call her. I will take her to the desert. I will speak kind to her. 🏜️💬❤️
## Hosea 2:15
I will give her grape fields. The sad valley will be a door of hope. She will sing like before, like when I led her out of Egypt. 🍇🚪✨🎵🇪🇬

I will make peace with animals and the land. No bow, no sword, no war. You will sleep safe. 🕊️🐑🌾🛌
## Hosea 2:19
I will marry you forever. I will do right and be kind. I will love you and show mercy. 💍♾️❤️
## Hosea 2:20
I will be true to you. You will know Me, your God. 🤝🙏

I will hear the sky, and the sky will help the land. 🌤️👂🌍
## Hosea 2:22
The land will give food, drink, and oil. All will help Jezreel. 🌾🥤🛢️➡️🌱
## Hosea 2:23
I will plant My people in the land. I will show mercy to “No Mercy.” I will say to “Not My People,” “You are My people.” They will say, “You are my God.” 🌱👨‍👩‍👧‍👦💬🙏
