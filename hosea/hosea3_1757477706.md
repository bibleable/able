## Hosea 3:1
God spoke to Hosea. God said, go love your wife again. She was not true. Love her like God loves Israel. Israel runs to fake gods and sweet cakes. ❤️👂➡️👩‍🦰🍰🙏
## Hosea 3:2
So Hosea paid money and food to get her back. 🪙🪙🌾🤝
## Hosea 3:3
Hosea said, stay with me many days. Do not go with other men. I will stay with you too. 🏠⏳🚫👨‍🦱👩‍🦰
## Hosea 3:4
God said, Israel will have many days with no king and no leader. They will not bring gifts to God. They will not use fake god things. 👑🚫⏳🎁🚫🗿🚫
## Hosea 3:5
Later, Israel will come back to God. They will look for God and for David’s king. They will come to God with a little fear and wow. God is good. 🔄🙏👑➡️😮💖
