## Romans 7:1
Paul talked to friends who know rules. 📘 He said rules lead a person while he lives. ⏳
## Romans 7:2
Paul said a wife is under her husband by rules while he lives. 💍 If he dies, she is free from that rule. ✂️
## Romans 7:3
So if the husband lives and she goes to another man, it is wrong. ❌ But if he dies, she is free, and she can marry another man. ✅
## Romans 7:4
Paul said, You are like that too. You died to old rules by Jesus. ✝️ Now you belong to Jesus. 🤝 You can grow good fruit for God. 🍎
## Romans 7:5
When we lived in our old way, bad wants were strong in our bodies. 💢 They made us do bad things. 🚫
## Romans 7:6
But now we are free from the old rules. 🕊️ We serve God in a new way, by God's Holy Spirit, not by old words on a page. ✨📖
## Romans 7:7
Is the rule bad? No. ❌ The rule shows what sin is. ✅ The rule said, “Do not want what is not yours.” 🚫👀 Then I knew that was sin.
## Romans 7:8
But sin used the rule to wake up many bad wants in me. 😈🔥 Without rules, sin felt quiet. 🤫
## Romans 7:9
I once felt alive when I did not know the rule. 🙂 But when the rule came, sin woke up, and I felt dead inside. ☠️
## Romans 7:10
The rule was meant to bring life. 🌱 But sin used the rule to bring death to me. ⚰️
## Romans 7:11
Sin tricked me by the rule. 🎭 Sin used the rule and hit me hard. 💥
## Romans 7:12
So the rule is holy and good. ✨ The rule is right. 👍
## Romans 7:13
Did the good rule make me die? No. ❌ Sin did that, so we can see sin is very bad. 😞 Sin used the good rule and brought death. ⚠️
## Romans 7:14
We know the rule is from God. 🙏 But I am weak. 💧 I am like a slave to sin. ⛓️
## Romans 7:15
I do not get what I do. 🤷 I do not do the good I want. ❌ I do the bad I hate. 😣
## Romans 7:16
If I do what I do not want, I agree the rule is good. ✅
## Romans 7:17
So it is not really me who does it, but sin living in me. 🕳️
## Romans 7:18
I know nothing good lives in my old self, in my body. 🚫 I want to do good, but I cannot make it happen. 🪫
## Romans 7:19
I do not do the good I want to do. 🚫 I keep doing the bad I do not want. 🔁
## Romans 7:20
If I do what I do not want, it is not the real me. It is sin living in me. 🌀
## Romans 7:21
So I see this: when I want to do good, bad is right there with me. ⚖️
## Romans 7:22
Inside, I like God’s rules. 💗📘
## Romans 7:23
But I see another bad rule in my body. 🧠 vs 💪 It fights me and makes me its slave to sin. ⚔️⛓️
## Romans 7:24
Oh! I feel so sad and tired. 😫 Who will save me from this body that ends in death? 🆘
## Romans 7:25
Thank You, God! 🙌 Jesus Christ saves me. ✝️ So with my mind I serve God’s rules, but my body still wants sin. 🧠❤️ vs 💪⚠️
