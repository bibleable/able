## Romans 13:1
Paul told all people: obey the leaders in the land. God put leaders there. 🏛️🙏
## Romans 13:2
If you fight the leaders, you fight what God set up. If you fight, you will get in trouble. ⚠️🚫
## Romans 13:3
Rulers are not scary if you do good. Do good, and the leader will say good job. 👍😊
## Romans 13:4
The leader works for God to help you. But if you do bad, be afraid. He can punish bad people. 👮‍♂️⚖️
## Romans 13:5
So you must obey, not just to skip trouble, but because your heart knows it is right. ❤️✅
## Romans 13:6
This is why you pay tax. Leaders serve God and work to keep order. 💰🧾
## Romans 13:7
Give to all what you owe: tax, money, respect, and honor. 🤝💵
## Romans 13:8
Do not owe anyone, except to love each other. If you love, you keep God’s rules. ❤️🤗
## Romans 13:9
God’s rules say: do not break your big promise, do not kill, do not steal, do not want what is not yours. All these say: love your neighbor like you love you. 📜🏘️❤️
## Romans 13:10
Love does no harm to a neighbor. So love keeps God’s rules. 🛡️❤️
## Romans 13:11
Do this now. Wake up! God will save us soon. It is closer than before. ⏰🌅
## Romans 13:12
Night is almost gone. Day is near. Say no to dark bad acts. Put on light good ways. 🌙➡️☀️✨
## Romans 13:13
Live good like in the day. Do not do wild bad party stuff. Do not drink too much. Do not be mean or fight. Do not be jealous. 🚫🍻🙂🤝
## Romans 13:14
Wear Jesus like new clean clothes. Follow Him. Do not plan to feed bad body wants. 👕✝️🚫
