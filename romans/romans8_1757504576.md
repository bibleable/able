## Romans 8:1
Now, if we belong to Jesus, there is no blame on us. We live by God's Holy Spirit, not by sin. 😊🕊️
## Romans 8:2
God's Holy Spirit gives life in Jesus. He makes us free from sin and death. ✝️🕊️🔓
## Romans 8:3
The old rules could not fix us. God sent His Son Jesus. He came like us and took on our sin. He stopped sin’s power. ✝️❤️
## Romans 8:4
Now we can do what is right. We live by God's Holy Spirit, not by our sin-self. 🚶‍♂️🕊️
## Romans 8:5
People who pick sin think about sin. People who pick God's Holy Spirit think about God’s way. 🤔➡️🕊️
## Romans 8:6
A sin mind leads to death. A Spirit mind leads to life and peace. 🧠☠️ / 🧠🌿🕊️
## Romans 8:7
A sin mind fights God. It will not obey God. It cannot. 😠✋
## Romans 8:8
People who live by sin cannot make God glad. 🚫🙂
## Romans 8:9
But you live by God's Holy Spirit, if God's Holy Spirit lives in you. If a person does not have God’s Holy Spirit from Jesus, they do not belong to Him. 🏠🕊️
## Romans 8:10
If Jesus is in you, your body will die because of sin, but God's Holy Spirit gives life because God makes you right. ✝️➡️🌿
## Romans 8:11
God raised Jesus from death by God's Holy Spirit. The same Spirit lives in you. He will make your bodies alive too. 🕊️⬆️🪦➡️🌿
## Romans 8:12
So we do not have to obey sin. We do not owe sin. ❌😈
## Romans 8:13
If you live by sin, you will die. But if you say “no” to bad things by God's Holy Spirit, you will live. ✋😈➡️🌿
## Romans 8:14
All who are led by God's Holy Spirit are God’s kids. 🕊️👨‍👩‍👧‍👦
## Romans 8:15
God did not make you slaves who fear. God made you His kids. We call God, “Abba! Father!” 🙌👶 “Abba! Father!”
## Romans 8:16
God's Holy Spirit tells our hearts, “You are God’s kids.” 💬🕊️❤️
## Romans 8:17
If we are God’s kids, we get good things with Jesus. We may have pain with Him now. Later we will share His bright joy. 🎁😢➡️😊✨
## Romans 8:18
Our pain now is small. God’s bright joy later is big. 📉😢 / 📈✨
## Romans 8:19
The world God made waits to see God’s kids. 🌍👀
## Romans 8:20
The world had to feel sad and wait. God let it be, but there is hope. 🌍😔⏳
## Romans 8:21
One day the world God made will be free. It will share the free, bright life of God’s kids. 🌍🔓✨
## Romans 8:22
All the world has pain, like a mom having a baby. 🌍🤰😣
## Romans 8:23
We feel pain too. We have God's Holy Spirit now. We wait for God to make our bodies new, as His kids. 🕊️⏳💪
## Romans 8:24
We are saved, and we hope. We do not see it yet. If we see it, we do not hope. 👀❌➡️🕊️
## Romans 8:25
We hope for what we do not see. So we wait and keep on. ⏳🙏
## Romans 8:26
God's Holy Spirit helps us when we are weak. We do not know how to pray. God's Holy Spirit prays for us with deep cries. 🕊️🤲😢
## Romans 8:27
God sees our hearts. God knows what God's Holy Spirit thinks. The Spirit prays for God’s people in God’s good way. 👀❤️🕊️
## Romans 8:28
We know God works in all things for good for people who love God. He calls them by His plan. 🔄❤️➡️👍
## Romans 8:29
God knew His people before. God planned for them to be like His Son Jesus, so Jesus would be the big Brother. 👦👦➡️👨‍👦
## Romans 8:30
God planned. God called. God made them right. God made them shine with joy. 📞✅✨
## Romans 8:31
So what now? If God is for us, no one can win against us. 🛡️💪
## Romans 8:32
God did not keep back His own Son. God gave Jesus for us all. With Jesus, God will give us all we need. 🎁✝️
## Romans 8:33
Who can say God’s people are bad? God is the One who makes us right. ☝️✅
## Romans 8:34
Who can punish us? Jesus died. Yes, He rose. He is at God’s right side. He prays for us. ✝️⬆️👑🙏
## Romans 8:35
Who can stop God’s love in Jesus? Can big trouble, sad fear, hurt, no food, no coat, danger, or a sword? No. 🚫❤️✝️
## Romans 8:36
The book says, “We may die for You. We are like sheep to be killed.” 🐑⚔️
## Romans 8:37
But in all this we win big by Jesus, who loves us. We win by His love. 🏆❤️
## Romans 8:38
I am sure: Not death, not life, not angels, not big rulers, not now, not later, can stop God’s love. ✅❤️
## Romans 8:39
Not high, not low, not anything God made, can stop God’s love in Jesus our Lord. Nothing. ❤️✝️🙌
