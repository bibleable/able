God said, Tell all the people: give towns to the Levite helpers. Give open land around each town. 🏙️🌾
## Numbers 35:3
The towns are homes for Levite helpers. The open land is for cows and other animals. 🏠🐄
## Numbers 35:4
Make a big space around each town, about 1,000 steps. 🚶‍♂️🚶‍♀️🟩
## Numbers 35:5
Make more space, about 2,000 steps on each side. The town is in the middle. ➕🏙️
## Numbers 35:6
Give 6 safe towns. If a person hurts someone by accident, he can run there. Add 42 more towns. 🛡️🏙️🏙️🏙️🏙️🏙️🏙️➕🏙️…
## Numbers 35:7
All the towns for the Levite helpers are 48 towns with open land. 4️⃣8️⃣🏙️
## Numbers 35:8
Big family groups give many towns. Small family groups give few. Everyone shares. 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦🤝
## Numbers 35:9
God spoke to Moses again. 📣
## Numbers 35:10
God said, When you all cross the river into the new land, 🛶🌍
## Numbers 35:11
Pick safe towns, so a person who kills by accident can run there. 🏃‍♂️🛡️
## Numbers 35:12
These towns keep the runner safe from the family helper who wants to pay back. The people must meet first and decide. 🛡️👨‍👩‍👧‍👦⚖️
## Numbers 35:13
You will have 6 safe towns. 6️⃣🛡️🏙️
## Numbers 35:14
Have 3 safe towns on one side of the river, and 3 in the new land. 3️⃣➕3️⃣🛡️
## Numbers 35:15
These safe towns are for your people, for new people, and for visitors too, if they kill by accident. 🧑‍🤝‍🧑🌍🛡️
## Numbers 35:16
If someone hits with iron and a person dies, he killed on purpose. He must die. ⚒️💢➡️💀
## Numbers 35:17
If someone throws a big stone and the person dies, he killed on purpose. He must die. 🪨💢➡️💀
## Numbers 35:18
If someone hits with a hard wood tool and the person dies, he killed on purpose. He must die. 🪵🔨💢➡️💀
## Numbers 35:19
The family helper must kill the one who killed on purpose when he sees him. 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦⚔️
## Numbers 35:20
If someone pushes with hate or throws a thing on purpose and the person dies, it is killing on purpose. 😠🤜📦➡️💀
## Numbers 35:21
If he hits because he hates, and the person dies, it is killing on purpose. The family helper must kill him when he meets him. 😠✊➡️💀
## Numbers 35:22
But if he pushes by surprise, not with hate, 🫢🤷‍♂️
## Numbers 35:23
Or he drops a stone and did not see the person, and the person dies, and he did not hate him, it was an accident. 🪨😮➡️💀
## Numbers 35:24
Then all the people will decide between the runner and the family helper. They use these rules. 👥📖
## Numbers 35:25
The people will save the runner from the family helper. They will bring him back to the safe town. He must stay there until the top priest dies. 🛡️🏙️⏳
## Numbers 35:26
But if the runner leaves the safe town, 🚶‍♂️🚫🏙️
## Numbers 35:27
And the family helper finds him outside and kills him, the helper is not guilty. 👀➡️⚔️
## Numbers 35:28
The runner must stay in the safe town until the top priest dies. After that, he can go home. 🏙️⏳➡️🏠
## Numbers 35:29
These rules are for you all, and for your kids, in every place you live. 📜🏘️
## Numbers 35:30
If someone kills a person, two or more people who saw it must say it. One person is not enough to make him die. 2️⃣👀✅ 1️⃣👀❌
## Numbers 35:31
Do not take money to save a killer who killed on purpose. He must die. 💰❌➡️💀
## Numbers 35:32
Do not take money to let the runner leave the safe town early. He must stay until the top priest dies. 💰❌⏳
## Numbers 35:33
Do not make the land dirty with blood. Blood on the land is very bad. Only the death of the killer can make it clean. 🩸🌍❌➡️🧼
## Numbers 35:34
Do not make the land bad. I, God, live with you all. 🏞️✨

## 1 Kings 11:11
God said to Solomon, I will take the rule of the land from you and give it to your helper. 🗝️➡️
## 1 Kings 11:12
But not in your days. For David, I will take it from your son. ⏳👶

I will not take all of it. I will give one tribe to your son, for David and for Jerusalem, the city I chose. 🕯️🏙️
## 1 Kings 11:14
God raised an enemy for Solomon: Hadad the Edomite. ⚔️

## 1 Kings 11:16
Joab stayed six months, until he cut off the men in Edom. ⏱️
## 1 Kings 11:17

Jeroboam son of Nebat, from Ephraim, of Zereda, served Solomon. His mom was Zeruah, a widow. He stood against the king. ✋👑
## 1 Kings 11:27
This is why: Solomon built up the city of David and fixed the wall. Jeroboam worked there. 🧱
## 1 Kings 11:28
Jeroboam was strong and good at work. Solomon made him boss over the work for the people of Joseph. 💪🛠️
## 1 Kings 11:29
One day Jeroboam left Jerusalem. Ahijah, a man of God from Shiloh, met him on the road. Ahijah wore a new coat. They were alone. 🧥🛣️
## 1 Kings 11:30
Ahijah took his new coat and tore it into twelve pieces. ✂️🧥
## 1 Kings 11:31
Ahijah said, Take ten pieces. God says, I will take the rule from Solomon and give ten tribes to you. 1️⃣0️⃣
## 1 Kings 11:32
Solomon will have one tribe, for David and for Jerusalem, the city God chose. 1️⃣🏙️
## 1 Kings 11:33
This will happen because they left God. They prayed to Ashtoreth, Chemosh, and Milcom. They did not walk in God’s way or keep God’s rules like David did. 🚶‍♂️❌🛐
## 1 Kings 11:34
But I will not take it all now. I will let Solomon be king all his life, for David. ⏳👑
## 1 Kings 11:35
I will take the rule from his son and give you ten tribes. 🔟➡️
## 1 Kings 11:36
I will give one tribe to his son, so David will have a light in Jerusalem, the city I chose. 🕯️🏙️
## 1 Kings 11:37
I will take you, and you will be king over Israel. You will rule what you want. 👑

If you obey Me, walk in My way, and keep My rules like David did, I will be with you. I will build your house strong. I will give Israel to you. 🤝🏠
## 1 Kings 11:39
I will bring pain to David’s family, but not forever. ⏲️
## 1 Kings 11:40
Solomon tried to kill Jeroboam. Jeroboam ran to Egypt, to King Shishak. He stayed there until Solomon died. 🏃‍♂️🛡️

The other things Solomon did, and his wise words, are in a book. 📖
## 1 Kings 11:42
Solomon was king in Jerusalem over all Israel for 40 years. 4️⃣0️⃣
## 1 Kings 11:43
Then Solomon died. They buried him in the city of David. His son Rehoboam became king. ⚰️➡️👑


## 1 Kings 12:1
King Rehoboam went to Shechem so the people could make him king. 👑🏞️
## 1 Kings 12:2
Jeroboam heard about this while he was in Egypt, so he came back home. 🧍‍♂️🇪🇬➡️🏠
## 1 Kings 12:3
The people sent for Jeroboam, and he and all Israel went to talk to King Rehoboam. 🗣️👥
## 1 Kings 12:4
The people said to the king, “Your dad Solomon made us work too hard; please make it easy, and we will serve you.” 🙏🧱
## 1 Kings 12:5
The king said, “Come back in three days,” so the people went away. ⏳🚶‍♂️🚶‍♀️
## 1 Kings 12:6
King Rehoboam asked the old men who helped King Solomon, “What should I say to the people?” 👴👂
## 1 Kings 12:7
The old men said, “Be kind and use good words; then they will serve you.” 😊🗣️
## 1 Kings 12:8
But Rehoboam did not listen to the old men; he asked the young men who grew up with him. 🙅‍♂️🧑‍🤝‍🧑
## 1 Kings 12:9
Rehoboam said to the young men, “What should I say to the people?” ❓🗣️
## 1 Kings 12:10
The young men said, “Say you will be harder than your dad.” 😠🔨
## 1 Kings 12:11
They told him to say, “My dad was hard; I will be even more strict and use tough whips.” 😡📣
## 1 Kings 12:12
Jeroboam and the people came back to the king on the third day, like the king said. 📅👥
## 1 Kings 12:13
The king answered the people in a rough way; he did not use the kind words from the old men. 🗣️❌😊
## 1 Kings 12:14
He said the words from the young men: “I will be harder and more strict than my dad.” 😠⬆️
## 1 Kings 12:15
The king did not listen to the people, and God let this happen to keep His word. ✋📜
## 1 Kings 12:16
When the people saw the king did not listen, they said, “We have no share with David; let us go home,” and they went home. 🏕️🚶‍♂️🚶‍♀️
## 1 Kings 12:17
But Rehoboam still ruled the people who stayed in the towns of Judah. 🏘️👑
## 1 Kings 12:18
King Rehoboam sent Adoram to the people, but all Israel threw stones at him and he died; the king ran away fast in his cart to Jerusalem. 🧱⚠️🏃‍♂️🛞
## 1 Kings 12:19
So Israel said no to David’s family and did not follow them from then on. ✋🏠
## 1 Kings 12:20
All Israel made Jeroboam king; only the Judah family group stayed with David’s family. 👑👥↔️
## 1 Kings 12:21
Rehoboam went to Jerusalem and got 180,000 strong men from Judah and Benjamin to fight Israel. 🛡️⚔️
## 1 Kings 12:22
But God spoke to Shemaiah, God’s man. 📣🙏
## 1 Kings 12:23
God said, “Tell Rehoboam, and Judah, and Benjamin, and the rest of the people…” ☝️👂
## 1 Kings 12:24
“Do not fight your family; go home, because I made this happen,” and they listened and went home like God said. 🕊️🏠
## 1 Kings 12:25
Jeroboam built up Shechem in the hill land of Ephraim and lived there; then he built Penuel. 🧱🏗️
## 1 Kings 12:26
Jeroboam thought, “The people may go back to Rehoboam.” 🤔🔙
## 1 Kings 12:27
He said, “If they go to God’s house in Jerusalem, they may turn back and kill me,” and he was scared. ⛪➡️😨
## 1 Kings 12:28
So the king made two gold calves and said, “It is too far to go to Jerusalem; here are your gods,” which was bad. 🐄🐄✨❌
## 1 Kings 12:29
He put one calf in Bethel and the other in Dan. 📍🐄📍
## 1 Kings 12:30
This was very wrong; people even went far to Dan to bow and pray to the calf. 🚶‍♂️🐄🙏❌
## 1 Kings 12:31
Jeroboam made altars on high hills and picked priests from all people, not from the Levi family. 🏞️⛏️👤❌
## 1 Kings 12:32
Jeroboam made a big party in the eighth month like the party in Judah; he burned gifts on the altar in Bethel for the calves and set up his priests. 🎉🔥🐄
## 1 Kings 12:33
On the fifteenth day of that month he went up to the altar he made in Bethel and burned more gifts; he picked this day by himself and made Israel do it too. 📅🔥❌


## 1 Kings 13:1
A man of God came from Judah to Bethel because God told him to go. King Jeroboam stood by the altar to burn on it. 🚶‍♂️➡️🏙️⛪🔥👑
## 1 Kings 13:2
The man of God cried to the altar, “Altar, listen! A boy named Josiah will come. He will stop bad priests. He will burn bones here.” 🗣️⛪⚠️👦📛🦴🔥
## 1 Kings 13:3
He said, “Here is a sign: the altar will break, and the ash will pour out.” ✋📢⛪💥🟤⬇️
## 1 Kings 13:4
The king heard and pointed, “Grab him!” His hand became stiff. He could not pull it back. 👑👉🗣️✋🧊
## 1 Kings 13:5
The altar broke, and ash poured out, just like the man of God said. ⛪💥🟤⬇️
## 1 Kings 13:6
The king said, “Please pray to God for me.” The man prayed, and the king’s hand was well again. 🙏✋✨
## 1 Kings 13:7
The king said, “Come eat with me. I will give you a gift.” 👑🍞🎁
## 1 Kings 13:8
The man of God said, “I will not go with you. I will not eat or drink here.” 🚫🍞🚫💧
## 1 Kings 13:9
“God told me, Do not eat. Do not drink. Do not go back the same way.” 🗣️🚫🍞🚫💧↩️🚫
## 1 Kings 13:10
So the man of God left by a new way. 🚶‍♂️➡️🛣️
## 1 Kings 13:11
An old prophet lived in Bethel. His sons told him what the man did and said. 👴🏠🗣️👦👦
## 1 Kings 13:12
He asked, “Which way did he go?” The sons showed the way. 👉🛣️
## 1 Kings 13:13
He said, “Get the donkey for me.” They got it, and he rode on it. 🐴🧍‍♂️➡️
## 1 Kings 13:14
He found the man of God under a big tree. He said, “Are you the man from Judah?” He said, “Yes.” 🌳🤝
## 1 Kings 13:15
The old man said, “Come home with me and eat.” 🏠🍞
## 1 Kings 13:16
The man of God said, “I cannot go with you. I cannot eat or drink here.” 🚫🚶‍♂️🍞💧
## 1 Kings 13:17
“God told me, Do not eat. Do not drink. Do not go back the same way.” 🗣️🚫🍞🚫💧↩️🚫
## 1 Kings 13:18
The old man said, “I am a prophet too. An angel told me you can come back and eat.” But he lied. 👴🗣️👼🍞↩️❌
## 1 Kings 13:19
So the man of God went back with him. He ate and drank in his house. 🚶‍♂️↩️🏠🍞💧
## 1 Kings 13:20
As they sat at the table, God gave a word to the old man. 🍽️✨
## 1 Kings 13:21
The old man said to the man of God, “God says, You did not listen to Me.” 🗣️⚠️👂❌
## 1 Kings 13:22
“You ate and drank where I said no. You will not be buried at your home.” 🍞💧🚫🏠🪦❌
## 1 Kings 13:23
After he ate and drank, the old man got the donkey for him. 🍽️🐴
## 1 Kings 13:24
On the road, a lion met the man of God and killed him. His body lay on the road. The donkey and the lion stood by it. 🛣️🦁⚔️🧍‍♂️❌🐴🦁
## 1 Kings 13:25
People saw the body and the lion by it. They told it in the city. 👀🛣️🦁🏙️📣
## 1 Kings 13:26
The old man heard and said, “It is the man of God. He did not listen to God. So the lion hit him.” 👴👂🗣️🦁⚠️
## 1 Kings 13:27
He said to his sons, “Get the donkey for me.” 👴👦🐴
## 1 Kings 13:28
He found the body in the road. The donkey and lion still stood there. The lion did not eat the body or the donkey. 🛣️🧍‍♂️❌🐴🦁⏸️
## 1 Kings 13:29
The old man picked up the body, put it on the donkey, and took it back. He came to the city to cry and to bury him. 👴📦🐴↩️🏙️😭🪦
## 1 Kings 13:30
He put the body in his own grave. He cried and said, “Oh my brother!” 🪦😭

## Ezekiel 33:1
God spoke to Ezekiel again. 🗣️
## Ezekiel 33:2
God said: Tell the people a story. In a land, they pick a man to watch the wall. He is a watchman. 👀🏰
## Ezekiel 33:3
When the watchman sees the enemy come, he blows a horn to warn the town. 📯⚠️
## Ezekiel 33:4
If a person hears the horn but does not run to be safe, he will get hurt. It is his own fault. 🏃‍♂️❌
## Ezekiel 33:5
He heard the horn but did not listen. He gets hurt. If he had listened, he would be safe. 👂➡️🚫/🛡️
## Ezekiel 33:6
If the watchman sees danger and does not blow the horn, people will die. God says the watchman did wrong. 👀🚫📯⚔️
## Ezekiel 33:7
God said: Ezekiel, I made you a watchman for Israel. Hear My words and tell them. 👂🗣️
## Ezekiel 33:8
If I say, “Bad man, you will die,” and you do not tell him, he will die, and I will say you did not tell. ☠️🗣️
## Ezekiel 33:9
But if you tell the bad man to stop and he will not stop, he will die for his bad. You will be safe. 🗣️➡️🚫☠️
## Ezekiel 33:10
God said: Say to the people, “You say, We did bad. We feel sad. Can we live?” 😔❓
## Ezekiel 33:11
Say, “God says, I do not like when bad people die. I want them to turn and live. Turn back. Please turn back. Why will you die?” 💔🔁❤️
## Ezekiel 33:12
Say, “If a good man starts to do bad, his good will not save him. If a bad man stops his bad, he will not stay in trouble.” 🔄
## Ezekiel 33:13
If I say to a good man, “You will live,” but he trusts his good and then does wrong, he will die for the wrong. ⚖️☠️
## Ezekiel 33:14
If I say to a bad man, “You will die,” but he stops his bad and does what is right, 🛑➡️👍
## Ezekiel 33:15
If he gives back what he stole and walks in good ways, he will live. He will not die. 🎁🚶‍♂️❤️
## Ezekiel 33:16
I will not count the old bad on him. He did right. He will live. 🧽❤️
## Ezekiel 33:17
But your people say, “God is not fair.” Their way is not fair. 🙅‍♂️⚖️
## Ezekiel 33:18
If a good man turns to bad, he will die for the bad. 🔄☠️
## Ezekiel 33:19
If a bad man turns from bad and does right, he will live. 🔄❤️
## Ezekiel 33:20
You say, “God is not fair.” But I will say what is right for each one, by what he does. 👤⚖️
## Ezekiel 33:21
Later, a man ran from the city and came to Ezekiel. He said, “The city fell.” 🏃‍♂️🏙️⬇️

## Ezekiel 33:24
God said: People left in the land say, “Abraham was one man and got the land. We are many. The land is ours.” 🧍➡️🌄👥
## Ezekiel 33:25
Say to them: You do bad. You eat in a bad way. You look to fake gods. You hurt people. Do you think you can keep the land? 🍖👀🗿💔
## Ezekiel 33:26
You trust in the sword. You do very bad things. You take your friend’s wife. Will you keep the land? ⚔️🚫💔
## Ezekiel 33:27
Say: People in the land will die by the sword. People in the field will be food for wild animals. People in towns and caves will die by sick. ⚔️🐺🤒
## Ezekiel 33:28
I will make the land empty. The strong power will end. No one will pass by. 🏜️🚫
## Ezekiel 33:29
Then they will know I am God, when the land is empty because they did very bad. 🙏🏜️
## Ezekiel 33:30
God said: Ezekiel, your people talk about you near walls and doors. They say, “Come hear what God says.” 🧍‍♂️🧍‍♀️🚪👂
## Ezekiel 33:31
They come and sit with you. They hear your words, but they do not do them. They say nice words, but they want more stuff. 🪑👂🗣️💰
## Ezekiel 33:32
To them, you are like a nice song with a good voice. They hear you, but they do not do it. 🎵👂🚫

## Daniel 5:7
The king yelled, “Bring the wise men!” He said, “Read the words, and I will give purple clothes, a gold chain, and make you number 3 boss.” 📣🧠👑
## Daniel 5:8
All the wise men came. They could not read the wall. They could not tell the king. ❌📝
## Daniel 5:9
The king got more scared. The big men did not know what to do. 😟🤷
## Daniel 5:10
The queen heard and came. She said, “O king, do not be scared. There is a man who can help.” 👑👸

All people were afraid of him. He could keep people alive or not. He could lift people up or make them low. 😨⬆️⬇️
## Daniel 5:20
But he got proud. Then God took his power. 😠➡️❌
## Daniel 5:21
He was sent away from people. He lived like an animal. He ate grass. His hair and nails grew long. Then he knew God rules all kings. 🌿🐂
## Daniel 5:22
Daniel said, “You, King Belshazzar, knew this. But you did not make your heart low.” 📣💔
## Daniel 5:23
You took God’s cups. You and your people drank from them. You said good things to fake gods. But you did not say God is great. God holds your life. 🏛️🥤🗿✋
## Daniel 5:24
So God sent the hand to write these words. ✋➡️📝

PERES means: Your kingdom will be split. It will go to the Medes and the Persians. ✂️➡️🛡️

The men said, We can trap him only by a rule about his God. 🪤🙏
## Daniel 6:6
The men went to the king and talked nice to him. 👑🙂
## Daniel 6:7
They said, Make a law: for 30 days no one may pray to any god or man but you, O king. If they do, throw them to the lions. 3️⃣0️⃣🙏🚫🦁

## Daniel 6:17
They put a big stone on the den. The king and leaders stamped it with rings. No one could move it. 🪨🔒💍
## Daniel 6:18
The king went home. He did not eat. He did not want music. He could not sleep. 🍽️🚫🎶🚫😴🚫
## Daniel 6:19
At dawn the king got up fast and ran to the lion den. 🌅🏃‍♂️🦁
## Daniel 6:20
He called out, very sad, Daniel, servant of the living God, did your God save you from the lions? You serve Him all the time. 📣😢🦁
## Daniel 6:21
Daniel said, King, live long! 🗣️👑
## Daniel 6:22
My God sent His angel. The angel shut the lions’ mouths. They did not hurt me. I did no wrong to God or to you, King. 😇🦁🤐
## Daniel 6:23
The king was very happy. He had Daniel lifted out. No hurt was on him. Daniel trusted God. 😀🙌
## Daniel 6:24
The king gave a strong order. The bad men who blamed Daniel were thrown to the lions. Their wives and kids too. The lions ate them fast. ⚖️🦁
## Daniel 6:25
Then King Darius wrote to all people in all lands. He said, Peace to you all. ✍️🌍🕊️
## Daniel 6:26
He said, I make a law: All people must respect the God of Daniel. He is the living God. He lives for all time. His rule will not end. 📜🙏⏳♾️

## Daniel 7:1
It was the first year of King Belshazzar in Babylon. Daniel had a night dream and wrote it down. ✍️😴
## Daniel 7:2
Daniel said, I saw the wind from the sky blow on a big sea at night. 💨🌊
## Daniel 7:3
Four big animals came out of the sea. Each one was different. 🐾🌊
## Daniel 7:4
The first looked like a lion with eagle wings. The wings came off. It stood like a man and got a man’s heart. 🦁🦅➡️🚶❤️
## Daniel 7:5
The second was like a bear. It raised one side. It had three ribs in its mouth. A voice said, get up and eat a lot. 🐻🦴🦴🦴🗣️

Then I saw a fourth animal. It was very scary and very strong. It had big iron teeth. It crushed and stomped. It was not like the others. It had ten horns. 🐉🦷🦷🔩🔟
## Daniel 7:8
I looked at the horns. A small horn came up. Three horns fell out. The small horn had eyes like a man and a mouth that spoke proud big words. 🦌👀🗣️
## Daniel 7:9
Many seats were set. God, very old and holy, sat down. His clothes were white like snow. His hair was like clean wool. His seat was like fire, with wheels like fire. 👑❄️🤍🔥🛞🔥
## Daniel 7:10
A river of fire came out. Many, many people served God. Many stood by Him. Court sat. The books were opened. 🔥🏞️👥👥📖
## Daniel 7:11
I kept looking because the small horn spoke proud big words. The big animal was killed. Its body was burned in the fire. 🗣️🔥❌
## Daniel 7:12
The other animals lost their rule. They were let live for a set time. ⏳
## Daniel 7:13
In my night dream, I saw Someone like a Son of Man come with the clouds. He came to God. They brought Him near. ☁️👤➡️🙏

I went near one who stood there and asked, Please tell me what this means. He told me and helped me know. 🚶‍♂️❓🗣️
## Daniel 7:17
He said, The four big animals are four kings on earth. 4️⃣👑🌍
## Daniel 7:18
But God’s holy people will get the land to rule. They will have it for all time. 🙌👑♾️
## Daniel 7:19
Then I wanted to know more about the fourth animal. It was so scary, with iron teeth and metal claws. It crushed and stomped. 🐉🔩🦷🗡️
## Daniel 7:20
I asked about the ten horns on its head, and the other horn that came and made three fall. That horn had eyes and a mouth that spoke very big words. It looked bigger than the rest. 🦌👀🗣️⬆️
## Daniel 7:21
I saw that horn fight God’s people. It was winning for a time. ⚔️😢
## Daniel 7:22
Then God, very old and holy, came. God judged for God’s people. The time came, and God’s people got the land to rule. 👑⚖️🙌
## Daniel 7:23
He said, The fourth animal is the fourth land to rule on earth. It will be different. It will eat the whole earth. It will stomp and break it. 🌍🐉🦷👣
## Daniel 7:24
The ten horns are ten kings. Another king will rise after them. He will be different. He will take down three kings. 🔟👑➕1⬇️3
## Daniel 7:25
He will speak against God. He will hurt and tire God’s people. He will try to change times and rules. God’s people will be under him for a set time: one time, two times, and half a time. 🗣️😠⏳1️⃣2️⃣🌓
## Daniel 7:26
But the court will sit. They will take away his rule. He will be done for good. ⚖️❌
## Daniel 7:27
Then the rule and the lands under the sky will be given to God’s holy people. His rule will last forever. All rulers will serve and obey Him. 🌎👑♾️🙏
## Daniel 7:28
This is the end of the dream. I, Daniel, was very troubled. My face changed. But I kept the dream in my heart. 😟🤐


## Daniel 8:1
Daniel had a new dream from God in year 3 of King Belshazzar. 🛏️🌙👑

## Daniel 8:4
The ram ran and hit to the west, north, and south. No one could stop it. 🐏💥⬅️⬆️⬇️🚫✋
## Daniel 8:5
Then a fast goat came from the west. It did not seem to touch the ground. It had one big horn. 🐐💨⬅️🛫1️⃣

## Daniel 8:9
From one horn came a small horn. It grew big to the south, to the east, and to the nice land. 🦴➡️🔸⬇️➡️🌿🏞️
## Daniel 8:10
It grew up to the sky. It threw star ones down and stepped on them. ⬆️🌌🌟⬇️👣
## Daniel 8:11
It tried to fight the Great Prince. It stopped the daily gifts to God. It hurt God’s house. ⚔️👑✋🍞🔥⛔️🏛️💔
## Daniel 8:12
People did bad sin. So the horn got to rule. It threw truth down. It won for a time. 🚫🙏➡️🔸👑📖⬇️🏆⏳
## Daniel 8:13
Two holy ones talked. One said, How long will this be? 👼👼🗣️⏱️❓

## Daniel 8:20
Gabriel said, The ram means two kings: Media and Persia. 🐏➡️👑👑🗺️
## Daniel 8:21
Gabriel said, The goat means the king of Greece. The big horn means the first big king. 🐐➡️👑🇬🇷 🦴➡️1️⃣👑
## Daniel 8:22
Gabriel said, The big horn broke. Four horns came. This means four new lands will come, but not as strong. 🦴💥➡️4️⃣🦴🗺️⬇️💪
## Daniel 8:23
Later, when they are almost done, a hard and mean king will rise. ⏰➡️👑😠⬆️
## Daniel 8:24
He will be strong, but not by his own power. He will hurt many. He will hurt God’s people. 💪❌🧍‍♂️⚡️➡️👥😢➡️🙏
## Daniel 8:25
He will trick many and think he is great. He will hurt many fast. He will fight the Great Prince. But God will break him. 🎭👥😤🏃‍♂️💥⚔️👑🛑

## Daniel 9:1
It was year 1 of King Darius. He was from the Medes. He was king over the land. 🗓️👑🌍
## Daniel 9:2
I, Daniel, read God’s book by Jeremiah. It said the city would be empty 70 years. 📖⏳🏙️
## Daniel 9:3
I prayed to God. I did not eat. I wore rough, sad clothes and sat in ashes. 🙏😔🍽️❌🧣
## Daniel 9:4
I said, God, You are big and good. You keep Your promise to people who love You. We did wrong. 🙌❤️
## Daniel 9:5
We sinned. We did bad. We did not do what You said. 🙇‍♂️🚫
## Daniel 9:6
We did not listen to Your men, the prophets. They spoke to our kings and all the people. 🗣️🙉👑
## Daniel 9:7
God, You are right. We feel bad and look down, near and far, because we sinned. 😞🌍
## Daniel 9:8
God, we and our kings feel bad. We sinned against You. 😔👑
## Daniel 9:9
God is kind and He forgives. But we turned away. ❤️🙏↩️❌
## Daniel 9:10
We did not obey Your voice. We did not walk by Your rules that the prophets gave. 🚫👂📜
## Daniel 9:11
All Israel broke Your rules. The words in the book of Moses came on us, because we sinned. 📖⚠️
## Daniel 9:12
You did what You said. You let big trouble come. No city had trouble like Your city. 🌩️🏙️
## Daniel 9:13
All this came like the book said. But we did not pray to turn from sin and learn Your way. 🙏❌🔄
## Daniel 9:14
So You watched and sent the trouble. You are right. We did not obey. 👀⚖️
## Daniel 9:15
Now, God, You brought Your people out of Egypt with a strong hand and made Your name big. We have sinned and done bad. 🖐️💪🚶‍♂️🇪🇬
## Daniel 9:16
Please, God, turn Your anger from Your city, Jerusalem, and Your special hill. Our sin made others make fun of Your city and people. 😢🙏🏙️⛰️
## Daniel 9:17
Now please hear us. Please smile on Your house that is empty, for Your name. 👂😊🏠
## Daniel 9:18
My God, please hear and see. Our city is broken. We ask not because we are good, but because You are very kind. 👀👂💔➡️❤️
## Daniel 9:19
God, hear. God, forgive. God, act now. Do not wait, for Your name. Your city and Your people have Your name. ⏰🙏✅
## Daniel 9:20
While I prayed and said sorry for my sin and my people’s sin, I asked for Your city and Your special hill. 🙏😢🏙️⛰️
## Daniel 9:21
While I prayed, the angel Gabriel came fast to me at evening time. He touched me. 👼⚡🌅✋
## Daniel 9:22
He taught me and said, Daniel, I came to help you understand. 🧠👨‍🏫
## Daniel 9:23
When you began to pray, a word came. I came to show you, for you are very loved. So listen and think about the dream. 💬💖🧠
## Daniel 9:24
God set 70 weeks for your people and your special city: to end sin, to stop wrong, to make sins gone, to bring good that lasts, to finish the dream, and to ready the most special. 7️⃣0️⃣🗓️✅✨
## Daniel 9:25
Know this: from the word to build Jerusalem to the special king, there will be 7 weeks and 62 weeks. The city and wall will be built again in hard days. 🏗️🏙️🧱⛈️
## Daniel 9:26
After the 62 weeks, the special one will die. A people of a leader to come will break the city and the house of God. The end will come fast, and war will go on; the place will be empty. ⚔️🏙️💥🌊
## Daniel 9:27
He will make a strong promise with many for one week. In the middle of the week he will stop gifts to God. A very bad thing will make the place empty, until the end comes. 📜1️⃣🛑🎁🚫

Later, Israel will come back to God. They will look for God and for David’s king. They will come to God with a little fear and wow. God is good. 🔄🙏👑➡️😮💖


## Hosea 4:1
God said, “Israel, listen to Me. You do not tell the truth. You do not love. You do not know God.” 👂📣❌❤️❌🙏❌

## Hosea 4:9
People and priest are the same in bad. I, God, will pay them back for bad. 👥➕⛪➡️🚫⚖️
## Hosea 4:10
They eat, but still feel empty. They chase wrong love and drink a lot, but it will not help. They left God. 🍞➡️😞🍺🍺➡️❌🙏❌

Idols help no one. People make them from wood or metal. They cannot talk. They tell lies. 🗿🤐
## Habakkuk 2:19
Sad for the one who says to wood or stone, “Wake up!” It may have gold and silver, but it is dead. It cannot teach. 🪵🪨✨😶
## Habakkuk 2:20
But God is in His holy house. Be quiet, all the earth, before Him. 🕊️🏛️🤫


## Habakkuk 3:1
Habakkuk said a prayer to God. 🙏
## Habakkuk 3:2
Habakkuk said, God, I hear what You did. I feel scared. Please do it again now. Please be kind when You are mad. 🙏😟
## Habakkuk 3:3
God came near. The sky was bright with God. The earth gave God praise. 🌟🌍
## Habakkuk 3:4
God shined like light. Power was in God’s hands. ✨✋
## Habakkuk 3:5
Sick went first before God. More sick came after God. 😷➡️
## Habakkuk 3:6
God stood. The land shook. Big hills moved. God is strong always. ⛰️💥
## Habakkuk 3:7
Far tents shook. Far people were scared. ⛺😨
## Habakkuk 3:8
God, were You mad at the rivers or the sea? You rode fast to save. 🌊🐎
## Habakkuk 3:9
You took out Your bow. Many arrows flew. The land broke, and water ran. 🏹💧
## Habakkuk 3:10
Hills saw You and shook. Big water roared loud. The deep lifted up like hands. ⛰️🌊🙌
## Habakkuk 3:11
The sun and moon stopped. Your bright light was like arrows and a spear. ☀️🌙✨
## Habakkuk 3:12
You marched on the land. You stomped the bad ones. 🚶‍♂️💥
## Habakkuk 3:13
You went to save Your people. You saved Your chosen one. You hit the bad leader down. 🛡️✅
## Habakkuk 3:14
You used their own arrows on them. They came fast to hurt me. They were glad to eat up the weak, but You stopped them. 🏹❌
## Habakkuk 3:15
You walked on the sea. Big waves moved under You. 🌊🚶
## Habakkuk 3:16
I hear, and I shake. My lips shake. My legs shake. But I will wait quiet. Bad day will come to those who hurt us. 😟🕰️
## Habakkuk 3:17
If no figs grow, no grapes come, no oil is made, no food in fields, no sheep, no cows, 🥀🍇❌🌾❌🐑❌🐄❌
## Habakkuk 3:18
I will still be glad in God. God saves me. 🙂🙏
## Habakkuk 3:19
God is my strength. God makes my feet like a deer. I can walk on high hills. This is a song. 🦌⛰️🎵


## Zephaniah 1:1

## Zephaniah 1:3
I will take away people, animals, birds, and fish. I will stop bad ways and bad people. 🧑‍🤝‍🧑🐄🐦🐟⛔
## Zephaniah 1:4
God says: I will act against Judah and the big city. I will stop Baal (a fake god). I will stop bad priests. ✋🏙️⛔🗿
## Zephaniah 1:5
God will stop people who bow on the roof to the sky and stars. They also say yes to a fake god. 🌟🏠🙏🚫
## Zephaniah 1:6
God will stop people who left God. They do not seek Him or ask Him. 🚶‍♂️❌🙏
## Zephaniah 1:7
Be quiet before God. His big day is near. He got it ready. 🤫🙏⏳📅
## Zephaniah 1:8
On that day, God will punish the king’s sons and the king’s men. He will punish people who copy bad ways from far lands. 👑👦👦⚖️🌍🚫
## Zephaniah 1:9
God will punish people who rush to do bad, who hurt and take by lies. 🏃‍♂️❌💔🤥
## Zephaniah 1:10
On that day, people will cry loud at the Fish Gate, in the next part of town, and on the hills. 🚪🐟📣🏘️⛰️😭
## Zephaniah 1:11
Cry, people in the market! Sellers and money men will be gone. 🛍️😭💸❌
## Zephaniah 1:12
God will look in the city with a light. He will find people who say, “God will do nothing.” He will punish them. 🔦🏙️🧐🗣️❌⚖️
## Zephaniah 1:13
They will lose their things and homes. They will build, but not live there. They will plant, but not drink. 📦❌🏠🚧❌🌱🍇❌
## Zephaniah 1:14
God’s big day is near. It comes fast. Strong men will cry. ⏰🏃‍♂️💨💪😭
## Zephaniah 1:15
It is a day of anger. A day of trouble. A dark day. 😠⚠️🌑☁️
## Zephaniah 1:16
It is a day of horn sound and war at big walls. 📯⚔️🏰
## Zephaniah 1:17
People will be in big trouble. They will walk like blind. They did wrong to God. They will fall in the dust. 😟🚶‍♂️🙈🌫️
## Zephaniah 1:18
Money will not save them. On God’s angry day, the land will burn hot. God will stop the bad fast. 💰❌🔥🌍⚡


## Zephaniah 2:1
All you people, come close. You did not say sorry to God. 📣👥
## Zephaniah 2:2
Come now, before the bad day comes, before God gets mad. ⏰⚠️
## Zephaniah 2:3
Look for God. Do right. Be kind and low. Maybe God will hide you on the bad day. 🙏✅🫶🛡️
## Zephaniah 2:4
Gaza will be empty. Ashkelon will be empty. At noon, Ashdod will be pushed out. Ekron will be pulled up. 🏙️➡️🚫
## Zephaniah 2:5
Bad news for sea towns, Cherethites. God says to Canaan, land of the Philistines: I will stop you. No one will live there. 🌊⚠️
## Zephaniah 2:6
The sea land will be grass fields. Sheep helpers will rest there. Flocks will have yards. 🌾🐑
## Zephaniah 2:7
The sea land will be for the small group of Judah. They will feed sheep there and sleep in Ashkelon at night. God will think of them and give back good. 🌊🐑🌙
## Zephaniah 2:8
God says: I heard Moab and Ammon say mean words. They made fun of my people and bragged about the land. 👂😠🗣️
## Zephaniah 2:9
God says: As I live, Moab will be like Sodom. Ammon will be like Gomorrah. The land will have salt and be waste. My people who live will take it. 🧂🏜️
## Zephaniah 2:10
This will come because they were proud and bragged at God’s people. 😑📣
## Zephaniah 2:11
God will show He is big. He will make false gods weak. All people in all lands will bow to God. 🌍🙇
## Zephaniah 2:12
God says to Cush: You too will be stopped by my sword. ⚔️
## Zephaniah 2:13
God will reach to the north. He will end Assyria. Nineveh will be like a dry desert. 🧭❌🏜️
## Zephaniah 2:14
Animals will sleep in that city. Birds will sit in the windows. The wood will show, and the place will be empty. 🐄🕊️🏚️
## Zephaniah 2:15
This city once said, “I am the best. No one else.” Now it is empty. Wild animals live there. People who pass hiss and shake a fist. 🗣️➡️🏚️🐺👊


## Zephaniah 3:1
God says, Bad city! You are mean. You hurt people. 😠🏙️
## Zephaniah 3:2
You do not listen. You do not learn. You do not trust God. You do not come near to Him. 🙉🚫🙏
## Zephaniah 3:3
Your leaders are like loud lions. Your judges are like wild wolves. They take all; nothing is left. 🦁🐺🍽️
## Zephaniah 3:4
Your teachers tell lies. Your priests break God’s rules. They hurt what is right. 🚫🗣️✝️
## Zephaniah 3:5
But God is in the city. He is good. He does right each day. Bad people do not feel bad. 🌅✨
## Zephaniah 3:6
God says: I took down other lands. I made their towns empty. No one walks there now. 🏚️🚫👣
## Zephaniah 3:7
God says: I hoped you would listen and be good. But you did more bad. 😞➡️😠
## Zephaniah 3:8
God says: Wait for Me. I will bring all lands. I will show My anger. The earth will feel it like fire. ⏳🌍🔥
## Zephaniah 3:9
Then I will make people talk clean. All will call to God. All will work together for Him. 🗣️🧼🤝

My people will not do wrong or tell lies. They will rest like sheep. No one will scare them. 🐑😴🛡️

God says: I will bring in the sad ones who missed the big days. You will not be picked on. 😢➡️🤗

Look! I will stop the mean ones. I will help the hurt ones. I will bring in the left-out ones. I will turn shame to praise. People will say good things about you. ✋😡➡️🩹🤝👏
## Zephaniah 3:20
At that time I will bring you home. All people will praise you. I will make things good again for you, and you will see it. God says this. 🏠🌍👏

## Haggai 1:2
God said, You say, “It is not time to build God’s house.” 🗣️⏰⛪️✋
## Haggai 1:3
God spoke again to Haggai. 🗣️📣
## Haggai 1:4
God said, You live in nice houses, but My house is broken. Is that right? 🏠✨ vs ⛪️💔
## Haggai 1:5
God said, Think about what you do. 🤔
## Haggai 1:6
You plant a lot but get a little. You eat, not full. You drink, not full. You wear coats, not warm. You get pay, but the bag has a hole. 🌱➡️🌾😕 🍞😕 🥤😕 🧥🥶 💰👜🕳️
## Haggai 1:7
God said again, Think about what you do. 🔁🤔
## Haggai 1:8
Go up the hill. Bring wood. Build My house. Then I will be happy, and all will see I am great, says God. ⛰️🪵⛪️🔨🙂✨
## Haggai 1:9
You hoped for much, but it was little. You brought it home, and I blew it away, says God. Why? My house is broken, but you all fix your own houses. 🤲➡️📦😞 💨🏠 ⛪️💔 🏠🔨
## Haggai 1:10
So the sky kept back the wet on the grass, and the earth kept back food. ☁️🚫💧🌿 🌍🚫🌾
## Haggai 1:11
I sent a dry time on the land and hills, on food plants, on grape drink, on oil, on people, on cows, and on all work. ☀️🔥⛰️🌾🍇🥤🛢️👨‍👩‍👧‍👦🐄🛠️
## Haggai 1:12
Then Zerubbabel, Joshua, and all the people obeyed God. They listened to Haggai, who God sent. The people were afraid of God. 👂✅ 🙏 😨
## Haggai 1:13
Haggai, God’s helper, told the people, God says, “I am with you.” 📣💬❤️👥

Some of you saw God’s house long ago. How does it look now? It looks small to you. 🏠👀
## Haggai 2:4
Be strong, Zerubbabel! Be strong, Joshua! You all be strong, people! Work on My house, for I am with you, says God. 💪🏗️🙏
## Haggai 2:5
I made a promise when you left Egypt. God’s Holy Spirit is with you all. Do not be afraid. 🤝🕊️
## Haggai 2:6
Soon I will shake the sky, the earth, the sea, and the dry land, says God. 🌌🌍🌊🌾

On month 9, day 24, in year 2 of King Darius, God spoke to Haggai again. 🗓️👑📣
## Haggai 2:11
God said, “Ask the priests about this rule.” ❓⛪
## Haggai 2:12
“If someone holds special-for-God meat in his coat, and the coat touches bread, soup, wine, oil, or food, does that food become special for God?” The priests said, “No.” 🍖🧥🍞🍲🍷🛢️
## Haggai 2:13
“If a person touched a dead body and is dirty, and then touches food, does the food become dirty?” The priests said, “Yes.” ☠️🤲🍞
## Haggai 2:14
Then Haggai said, “God says, ‘This people is like that. Their work and gifts are dirty to Me.’” 🧱🎁
## Haggai 2:15
“Think about this from today on. Think how it was before you all put one stone on another in My house.” 🧠🧱🧱
## Haggai 2:16
“You hoped for 20 bags, but got 10. You went for 50 jars of wine, but got 20.” 📦➡️🔟🍷➡️2️⃣0️⃣
## Haggai 2:17
“I sent bad plant spots, mold, and hail to hit your work. But you did not come back to Me,” says God. 🌿🦠🌨️
## Haggai 2:18
“Think from today, month 9 day 24. Think from when you set the base of My house. Think on it.” 🗓️🏠🧱
## Haggai 2:19
“You have no seed in the barn. The grape vine, the fig, and the olive gave no food. But from today I will bless you.” 🌾🏚️🍇🍈🫒➡️💝
## Haggai 2:20
God spoke to Haggai a second time that same day. 📣🗓️
## Haggai 2:21

God was very mad at the dads long ago. 😠
## Zechariah 1:3
God said, Come back to Me, and I will come back to you. ↩️❤️
## Zechariah 1:4
Do not be like the dads long ago; they did not listen when men from God said, Turn back to God. 🙅‍♂️👂

Then God showed Zechariah four makers, work men with tools. 👷‍♂️👷‍♀️🛠️

## Zechariah 7:11
But the people did not listen. They turned away. They shut their ears. 🙉↩️
## Zechariah 7:12
Their hearts got hard. They would not hear the law and the words God sent by God’s Holy Spirit to His teachers long ago. So God was very angry. 💔📜🕊️🔥
## Zechariah 7:13
God said, “I called, and you did not hear. You called, and I did not hear.” 📞🙉➡️📞🙉

I sent them to far lands, but there they will remember Me. They will live and come back with their kids. 🌍🧠👨‍👩‍👧
## Zechariah 10:10
I will bring them home from Egypt and Assyria. They will live in Gilead and Lebanon. They will be so many that the place is too small. 🏠🗺️🌳
## Zechariah 10:11
I will go through the sea of trouble. I will hit the waves, and the deep will dry. Assyria will stop being bossy. Egypt will stop being boss. 🌊✋➡️🟫

I will make My people strong in Me. They will walk safe in My name. God says this. 🚶‍♂️💪🙏


## Zechariah 11:1
God says to a land named Lebanon: open your doors. Fire will burn your big trees. 🚪🔥🌲

Cry, little trees and big trees. The big trees in Bashan fall down. The thick woods are cut. 😢🌳🪵✂️
## Zechariah 11:3
Hear the sheep leaders cry. Their good place is gone. Hear lions roar by the Jordan. The brush is smashed. 🐑😭🦁🌿
## Zechariah 11:4
God tells Zechariah to be a sheep leader for sad, hurt sheep. 🐑👣
## Zechariah 11:5
Bad men buy the sheep and kill them. Bad men sell them and say, “We are rich.” Their sheep leaders do not care. 💰😠⚔️
## Zechariah 11:6
God says, I will not stop the hurt now. People will fight each other. A king will be mean. The land will be broken. I will not save them then. ⚔️😢🏙️💥
## Zechariah 11:7
So I led the sad sheep. I took two sticks. I named one Good. I named one Together. I took care of the sheep. 🐑🪵🪵
## Zechariah 11:8
In one moon, I stopped three bad sheep leaders. I was tired of them. They did not like me. 🌙➕➕➕🚫
## Zechariah 11:9
I said, I will not lead you now. Let the sick die. Let the weak fall. The rest will hurt each other very, very bad. 💔⚠️
## Zechariah 11:10
I broke the stick named Good. This ended the big promise. 🪵💔
## Zechariah 11:11
That day, the careful sheep knew God had spoken. 👀🙏
## Zechariah 11:12
I said, Pay me if you want. If not, do not. They paid me 30 silver coins. 🪙🪙🪙
## Zechariah 11:13
God said, Throw the money to the potter at God’s house. This pay is not kind. I threw the 30 coins in God’s house for the potter. 🪙➡️🏠🏺
## Zechariah 11:14
Then I broke the stick named Together. The two groups, Judah and Israel, did not stay like brothers. 🪵💔👬❌
## Zechariah 11:15
God said, Now act like a silly, bad sheep leader. 🎭🐑
## Zechariah 11:16
A bad sheep leader will come. He will not help hurt ones. He will not look for lost ones. He will not heal. He will not feed. He will hurt the sheep, even take their feet. 😡🐑❌🦶
## Zechariah 11:17
Bad sheep leader, big trouble to you! A sword will hit his arm and eye. His arm will dry up. His right eye will be blind. ⚔️💪❌👁️❌

On that day, fake teachers will feel shame. They will not wear a trick coat to fool people. 😳🧥🚫

If someone asks, “Why are there cuts on your hands?” he will say, “I got them at a friend house.” ✋🤕🏠
## Zechariah 13:7
God says, “Sword, wake up. Hit the leader of the sheep. The sheep will run away.” God will let the little ones have a hard time. ⚔️🐑🏃‍♂️👶
## Zechariah 13:8
In the land, many will be gone. Only a few will stay. 🌍😢➡️🙂
## Zechariah 13:9
The few will have hard times, like hot fire. This will make them good and strong. They will call to God. God will answer. God will say, “They are My people.” They will say, “God is our God.” 🔥💪📞🙏❤️👂

God knows Paul prays for you all the time. Paul serves God with his whole heart as he shares Jesus’ good news. 💓🙏
## Romans 1:10
Paul asks God to let him visit you soon, if God wants. 🛤️🤲
## Romans 1:11
Paul wants to see you and help make your trust in God strong. 🤝💪
## Romans 1:12
Paul wants you and him to cheer each other up by trusting God. 😊🔄
## Romans 1:13
Paul tried to come before but could not. He wants to help more people there know God, like in other places. 🚫➡️🌱
## Romans 1:14
Paul must share with all people, smart or not, near or far. 👥🌎
## Romans 1:15
So Paul is ready to share the good news with you in Rome too. 🏛️📣
## Romans 1:16
Paul is not shy about the good news. It is God’s power to save all who trust Jesus, Jews first and also others. ✝️⚡️
## Romans 1:17
In this good news, God shows how to be right with Him. We live by trust in Jesus. 📖❤️
## Romans 1:18
God is angry at all wrong. Some people hide the truth. ⚠️😠
## Romans 1:19
God made it clear who He is. He showed them. 👀✨
## Romans 1:20
We can see God’s power and care in the world He made, so people have no good excuse. 🌞🌳🌊
## Romans 1:21
They knew about God but did not honor or thank Him. Their thoughts got mixed up, and their hearts felt dark. 🙁🌑
## Romans 1:22
They said, “We are smart,” but they were not. 🤷‍♂️🙃
## Romans 1:23
They swapped the great God for fake god statues of people and animals. 🗿🐦🐄🐍
## Romans 1:24
So God let them do what they chose. They used their bodies in wrong ways. 🚫🧍‍♀️🧍‍♂️
## Romans 1:25
They picked a lie, not God’s truth. They loved and served things God made, not God the maker. ❌🗣️➡️🛐🌟
## Romans 1:26
So God let them keep their wrong ways. Women used their bodies in ways that were not how God made them. 🚫👩
## Romans 1:27
Men also used their bodies in ways that were not God’s plan, and it brought hurt to them. 🚫👨😔
## Romans 1:28
They did not want God, so God let them think bad and do bad things. 🧠➡️🚫
## Romans 1:29
They were full of all kinds of bad: greed, envy, hate, fighting, and tricking others. 😡💢
## Romans 1:30
They said mean things, hated God, were rude and proud, bragged, made up bad ideas, and did not obey parents. 👄😠🙅‍♂️
## Romans 1:31
They were foolish and mean. They did not keep promises. They did not love or care. 💔
## Romans 1:32
They knew God says these things are very bad and lead to a bad end, but they still did them and cheered when others did them. 👏❌


## Romans 2:1
Paul says: You who say, “You are bad,” have no excuse. You do wrong too. When you point at them, you point at you. 👉⚖️
## Romans 2:2
God judges right. He knows the truth. He will judge people who do wrong. ⚖️👀
## Romans 2:3
You who judge others, do you think you can get away? No. God will judge you too. 😮⚖️
## Romans 2:4
Do not step on God’s kind love. God is kind. He waits. He is patient. His kind love helps you stop wrong and turn back. ❤️⏳🔄
## Romans 2:5
Your hard heart will not turn. You pile up God’s anger for the day God judges. God is fair. 💔🔥⚖️
## Romans 2:6
God will pay each one for what they do. 🧾⚖️
## Romans 2:7
People who keep doing good and do not give up will get life that never ends. 😊🏅♾️
## Romans 2:8
But people who say, “I want my way,” and do not obey truth will have trouble and pain. 😠🔥
## Romans 2:9
All who do wrong will have a hard time and feel tight inside. Jews first, then other people. 😣⛔
## Romans 2:10
All who do good will have praise and peace. Jews first, then others. 😊🕊️
## Romans 2:11
God is fair to all. God does not pick one side. ⚖️🤝
## Romans 2:12
People who do wrong and do not know God’s rules will still be punished. People who do wrong and know God’s rules will be judged by those rules. 📜⚖️
## Romans 2:13
It is not enough to hear God’s rules. You must do them. 👂❌➡️✅
## Romans 2:14
People who are not Jews do not have God’s rules, but sometimes they do what is right anyway. This shows the rule is inside them. 🙂❤️
## Romans 2:15
Their hearts say, “Do right.” Their own thoughts tell them when they do wrong or right. ❤️🧠☝️
## Romans 2:16
One day God will judge even secret things. He will do this by Jesus. 📅🔍✝️
## Romans 2:17
You say, “I am a Jew.” You rest on God’s rules. You say, “I know God.” 🗣️📜🙏
## Romans 2:18
You say you know what God wants. You say, “This is good.” You learned from God’s rules. 👍📖
## Romans 2:19
You think, “I can lead people who cannot see. I am a light for people in dark.” 🕯️👣
## Romans 2:20
You think, “I teach people. I teach kids. I have truth in God’s rules.” 🧑‍🏫📘
## Romans 2:21
But you who teach, do you teach you? You say, “Do not steal,” but do you steal? 🤔👜
## Romans 2:22
You say, “Do not cheat on your wife or husband.” But do you cheat? You say, “Do not love fake gods.” But do you steal from God’s house? ❓💔🏠
## Romans 2:23
You say, “I am good with God’s rules.” But you break them and make God look bad. 😞
## Romans 2:24
Long ago it was written: People who are not Jews say bad things about God because of you. 😢🗣️
## Romans 2:25
The mark on the body for God’s people helps if you obey God’s rules. But if you break the rules, that mark means nothing. 🏷️➡️🚫
## Romans 2:26
If a man with no mark does what God says, God will see him like a man with the mark. 👨✅👀
## Romans 2:27
Then the man with no mark, who does obey, will show you are wrong, you who have the rules and the mark but do not obey. ☝️⚖️
## Romans 2:28
You are not God’s true person just on the outside. The mark on the body is not the main thing. 🚫👕➡️❤️
## Romans 2:29
God’s true person is one on the inside. The real mark is on the heart. God’s Holy Spirit does it, not just words on a page. Praise comes from God, not from people. 🙏❤️🕊️


## Romans 3:1
Paul says: What good is it to be a Jew? 🤔
## Romans 3:2
Paul says: It is good in many ways. God gave Jews His words first. 📖✨
## Romans 3:3
Paul says: If some do not trust, does that stop God? No. 🙅‍♂️
## Romans 3:4
Paul says: No way! God is true. People can lie. God wins and shows He is right. 🛡️✅
## Romans 3:5
Paul says: If our wrong shows God is right, is God wrong to punish? I talk like a man. 🤨
## Romans 3:6
Paul says: No way! God must judge the world. 🌍⚖️
## Romans 3:7
Paul says: If my lie makes God’s truth look big, why am I called bad? 🤷‍♂️
## Romans 3:8
Paul says: Some say, “Do bad so good will come.” This is not true. They will be punished. 🚫😠
## Romans 3:9
Paul says: So what now? Are Jews better? No. All people do sin. 🙍‍♀️🙍‍♂️
## Romans 3:10
Paul says: No one is good by self. Not one. 🚫👍
## Romans 3:11
Paul says: No one gets it. No one looks for God. 👀❌
## Romans 3:12
Paul says: All turn away. No one does good. Not even one. ↩️🚫
## Romans 3:13
Paul says: Their words are lies. Their mouths can hurt like a snake. 🐍👄
## Romans 3:14
Paul says: They say mean words and hard words. 😡🗣️
## Romans 3:15
Paul says: They run fast to hurt. 🏃‍♂️💥
## Romans 3:16
Paul says: Where they go, there is mess and sad. 🛣️💔
## Romans 3:17
Paul says: They do not know peace. ☮️❌
## Romans 3:18
Paul says: They do not fear God. 👀😐
## Romans 3:19
Paul says: The rules talk to who are under rules. All mouths stop. All the world is wrong before God. 🤐🌍
## Romans 3:20
Paul says: No one is made right by doing rules. Rules show our sin. 📜🔍
## Romans 3:21
Paul says: But now God shows a new way to make us right, not from rules. The old books said this would come. 🌟📖
## Romans 3:22
Paul says: God makes us right when we trust Jesus. This is for all who believe. No difference. ✝️🤝
## Romans 3:23
Paul says: All people did sin. We do not reach God’s good way. 🎯❌
## Romans 3:24
Paul says: God makes us right as a free gift. Jesus sets us free. 🎁✝️
## Romans 3:25
Paul says: God put Jesus to die and give His blood for us. We take this by trust. This shows God is right. Before, God did not punish old sins. ❤️🩸
## Romans 3:26
Paul says: Now God shows He is fair. He makes right the one who trusts Jesus. ⏰✅
## Romans 3:27
Paul says: Can we brag? No. Not by work or rules. We are made right by trust. 🙅‍♂️💬
## Romans 3:28
Paul says: We say a person is made right by trust, not by doing rules. 🧍‍♂️🙏
## Romans 3:29
Paul says: Is God for Jews only? No. God is for all people too. 🌍🤗
## Romans 3:30
Paul says: There is one God. He makes both groups right by trust in Jesus. 1️⃣🤝
## Romans 3:31
Paul says: Do we stop the rules by trust? No. We make the rules stand. 📜✅


## Romans 4:1
Paul says, “What did Abraham, our big family dad, find?” 🤔👴
## Romans 4:2
If Abraham was made right by what he did, he could brag. But not to God. 😎🙅‍♂️
## Romans 4:3
The book says, “Abraham trusted God. God said he was right.” 📖🙏✅
## Romans 4:4
If you work, your pay is not a gift. It is what you earn. 👷💰➡️🧾
## Romans 4:5
But if you do not work and you trust God who makes bad people right, God says you are right. 🙏➡️✅
## Romans 4:6
David says this too: Happy is the one God calls right, not by work. 🎵😊
## Romans 4:7
Happy are the ones God forgives. Their bad things are covered. 😊🧼
## Romans 4:8
Happy is the one God will not count bad things. 😊🙅‍♂️🧮
## Romans 4:9
Is this happy gift only for the body sign group, or for all? We say Abraham was called right by trust. ❓👥🎁✅
## Romans 4:10
When did God call him right? Before the body sign, or after? Before. ⏰⬅️✅
## Romans 4:11
He got a body sign. The sign showed he was right by trust when he had no sign. So he is dad of all who trust with no sign. God will call them right too. 🚩🙏👨‍👩‍👧‍👦✅
## Romans 4:12
He is also dad of the sign group who walk in his trust steps. 👣👪🙏
## Romans 4:13
God gave a big promise to Abraham and his kids: He would get the world. Not by rules, but by trust. 🌍🎁📜❌🙏
## Romans 4:14
If only rule keepers get it, then trust is nothing, and the promise is gone. 📜➡️🚫🙏💨
## Romans 4:15
Rules bring anger. If there is no rule, you cannot break it. 📜😠🚫
## Romans 4:16
So the promise comes by trust. This kind gift is sure for all his kids. Not only the rule group, but all who trust like Abraham. He is dad of us all. 🎁✅👨‍👩‍👧‍👦🙏
## Romans 4:17
God said, “I made you dad of many families.” Abraham stood before God. He trusted God. God makes dead live. God makes things from nothing. 🗣️👨‍👩‍👧‍👦⚰️➡️🌱✨
## Romans 4:18
He hoped and trusted, even when it was hard. He would be dad of many families, like God said, “So many kids.” 🌟🙏👶👶👶
## Romans 4:19
He did not give up. He was very old. Sarah could not have a baby. But he still trusted. 👴👵🚫👶🙏
## Romans 4:20
He did not stop. He grew strong in trust and said, “God is big!” 💪🙏🙌
## Romans 4:21
He was sure God can do what He said. ✅🗣️🏁
## Romans 4:22
So God said he was right, because he trusted. ✅🙏
## Romans 4:23
These words, “God said he was right,” were not only for him. 📝➡️👤➕👥
## Romans 4:24
They are for us too. God will say we are right if we trust Him who made Jesus our Lord alive again. 🙋‍♀️🙋‍♂️✅🙏✝️🪦➡️🌅
## Romans 4:25
Jesus died for our bad things. God made Him alive to make us right with God. ✝️😢➡️🪦🌅😊✅


## Romans 5:1
Paul says we believe in Jesus. God makes us right. Now we have peace with God by Jesus. ✝️🕊️
## Romans 5:2
By Jesus we come near to God. God is kind to us. We stand strong. We are happy and we hope for God’s good life. 😊🙏✨
## Romans 5:3
We are glad even when life is hard. Hard things help us keep going. 🙂🌧️💪
## Romans 5:4
Keeping on makes us true and strong. Being true and strong makes us hope. 💪✅🌟
## Romans 5:5
Hope will not fail. God puts God’s love in our hearts. God’s Holy Spirit gives it to us. ❤️🕊️
## Romans 5:6
We were weak. At the right time, Jesus died for bad people. ⏰✝️
## Romans 5:7
It is rare to die for a good person. Maybe for a very good friend, one might die. 🤔👤
## Romans 5:8
But God shows God’s love for us: while we were still doing bad, Jesus died for us. ❤️✝️
## Romans 5:9
Jesus gave His blood for us. Now God says we are right. God will save us from being punished. 🩸🛟
## Romans 5:10
We were God’s enemy. But Jesus died and made us God’s friend. Now Jesus lives. He will save us. 🤝✝️🌅
## Romans 5:11
We are very glad in God. This is by Jesus. He made us God’s friend. 🎉🙏
## Romans 5:12
One man, Adam, did a bad thing. Then sin came in. Death came too. All people did bad. So all people die. 🍎🚪💀
## Romans 5:13
Bad was in the world before God’s rules. But when there are no rules, bad is not counted the same. Still, bad was there. 📜❌
## Romans 5:14
From Adam to Moses, death was boss. It hit even those who did not break a rule like Adam. Adam points to Jesus, who would come. ⛓️➡️👤➡️✝️
## Romans 5:15
Adam did a bad thing. Many died. But God’s gift by Jesus is much bigger. God is very kind. 🎁➕
## Romans 5:16
One bad thing made many “guilty.” But God’s free gift, after many bad things, says we are right. 🎁✅
## Romans 5:17
Adam’s bad made death the boss. But Jesus brings a big gift. God makes us right. We will live and win with Jesus. 👑✝️🌱
## Romans 5:18
One bad made all people guilty. One good by Jesus makes many right and gives life. ✝️🌟
## Romans 5:19
Adam did not obey. Many became bad. Jesus did obey. Many become right. 🚫➡️😞 ✅➡️🙂
## Romans 5:20
God’s rules came. People saw more bad. But God’s kind gift was even more and more and more. 📜😟 ➡️ 🎁🎁🎁
## Romans 5:21
Bad was boss and brought death. Now God’s kind gift is boss. God makes us right. We get life that never ends by Jesus. ♾️✝️😊


## Romans 6:1
Paul asks: Should we keep doing bad so God gives more love and help? ❓
## Romans 6:2
Paul says: No! We are done with bad. We cannot live in bad now. 🙅‍♂️
## Romans 6:3
Paul says: Do you know? When we went into water to show we are with Jesus, we joined His death. 💧✝️
## Romans 6:4
We went under the water and came up. Jesus died, and God made Him live again. We live a new life now. 💧➡️😊
## Romans 6:5
If we are joined with His death, we will be joined with His new life too. 🤝✨
## Romans 6:6
Our old bad self was put on the cross with Jesus. The bad power is not boss now. We will not help bad. ✝️🛑
## Romans 6:7
When a person dies, bad does not boss him. ⚖️🔓
## Romans 6:8
If we died with Jesus, we believe we will live with Him too. 🤍✝️
## Romans 6:9
We know Jesus came back to life and will not die again. Death cannot boss Him. 👑🕊️
## Romans 6:10
Jesus died one time to end bad. Now He lives for God. ✝️➡️🌟
## Romans 6:11
You too: think you are dead to bad, but alive for God, because of Jesus. 😀🙏
## Romans 6:12
Do not let bad be the boss of your body. Do not do what bad wants. 🚫💭
## Romans 6:13
Do not use your hands and feet to do bad. Give yourself to God. You are like alive again. Use your body to do good for God. 🙌👐
## Romans 6:14
Bad will not be your boss. You are not under rules only. You live under God’s love gift. 🎁💖
## Romans 6:15
So what now? Can we do bad since we are under God’s love gift, not rules? No! 🚫
## Romans 6:16
Who you obey is your boss. If you obey bad, it leads to death. If you obey right, it leads to good life. 👂➡️👍
## Romans 6:17
Thank You, God! You used to obey bad. But now you listen with your heart to the good way we told you. 🙏❤️
## Romans 6:18
God made you free from bad. Now you do what is right and good. 🔓➡️😊
## Romans 6:19
I talk in easy words for you. Before, you used your body for dirty bad again and again. Now use your body for right again and again, to be clean for God. 🧼
## Romans 6:20
When bad was your boss, you did not do what is right. 🚫👍
## Romans 6:21
What good did you get then? Now you feel sorry for those things. They end in death. 😔⚰️
## Romans 6:22
But now God made you free from bad. Now you are with God. Good things grow in you. In the end, you have life with God that never ends. 🌿🌈
## Romans 6:23
Bad pays with death. But God gives a free gift: life that never ends with Jesus Christ our Lord. 🎁✝️💖


## Romans 7:1
Paul talked to friends who know rules. 📘 He said rules lead a person while he lives. ⏳
## Romans 7:2
Paul said a wife is under her husband by rules while he lives. 💍 If he dies, she is free from that rule. ✂️
## Romans 7:3
So if the husband lives and she goes to another man, it is wrong. ❌ But if he dies, she is free, and she can marry another man. ✅
## Romans 7:4
Paul said, You are like that too. You died to old rules by Jesus. ✝️ Now you belong to Jesus. 🤝 You can grow good fruit for God. 🍎
## Romans 7:5
When we lived in our old way, bad wants were strong in our bodies. 💢 They made us do bad things. 🚫
## Romans 7:6
But now we are free from the old rules. 🕊️ We serve God in a new way, by God's Holy Spirit, not by old words on a page. ✨📖
## Romans 7:7
Is the rule bad? No. ❌ The rule shows what sin is. ✅ The rule said, “Do not want what is not yours.” 🚫👀 Then I knew that was sin.
## Romans 7:8
But sin used the rule to wake up many bad wants in me. 😈🔥 Without rules, sin felt quiet. 🤫
## Romans 7:9
I once felt alive when I did not know the rule. 🙂 But when the rule came, sin woke up, and I felt dead inside. ☠️
## Romans 7:10
The rule was meant to bring life. 🌱 But sin used the rule to bring death to me. ⚰️
## Romans 7:11
Sin tricked me by the rule. 🎭 Sin used the rule and hit me hard. 💥
## Romans 7:12
So the rule is holy and good. ✨ The rule is right. 👍
## Romans 7:13
Did the good rule make me die? No. ❌ Sin did that, so we can see sin is very bad. 😞 Sin used the good rule and brought death. ⚠️
## Romans 7:14
We know the rule is from God. 🙏 But I am weak. 💧 I am like a slave to sin. ⛓️
## Romans 7:15
I do not get what I do. 🤷 I do not do the good I want. ❌ I do the bad I hate. 😣
## Romans 7:16
If I do what I do not want, I agree the rule is good. ✅
## Romans 7:17
So it is not really me who does it, but sin living in me. 🕳️
## Romans 7:18
I know nothing good lives in my old self, in my body. 🚫 I want to do good, but I cannot make it happen. 🪫
## Romans 7:19
I do not do the good I want to do. 🚫 I keep doing the bad I do not want. 🔁
## Romans 7:20
If I do what I do not want, it is not the real me. It is sin living in me. 🌀
## Romans 7:21
So I see this: when I want to do good, bad is right there with me. ⚖️
## Romans 7:22
Inside, I like God’s rules. 💗📘
## Romans 7:23
But I see another bad rule in my body. 🧠 vs 💪 It fights me and makes me its slave to sin. ⚔️⛓️
## Romans 7:24
Oh! I feel so sad and tired. 😫 Who will save me from this body that ends in death? 🆘
## Romans 7:25
Thank You, God! 🙌 Jesus Christ saves me. ✝️ So with my mind I serve God’s rules, but my body still wants sin. 🧠❤️ vs 💪⚠️


## Romans 8:1
Now, if we belong to Jesus, there is no blame on us. We live by God's Holy Spirit, not by sin. 😊🕊️
## Romans 8:2
God's Holy Spirit gives life in Jesus. He makes us free from sin and death. ✝️🕊️🔓
## Romans 8:3
The old rules could not fix us. God sent His Son Jesus. He came like us and took on our sin. He stopped sin’s power. ✝️❤️
## Romans 8:4
Now we can do what is right. We live by God's Holy Spirit, not by our sin-self. 🚶‍♂️🕊️
## Romans 8:5
People who pick sin think about sin. People who pick God's Holy Spirit think about God’s way. 🤔➡️🕊️
## Romans 8:6
A sin mind leads to death. A Spirit mind leads to life and peace. 🧠☠️ / 🧠🌿🕊️
## Romans 8:7
A sin mind fights God. It will not obey God. It cannot. 😠✋
## Romans 8:8
People who live by sin cannot make God glad. 🚫🙂
## Romans 8:9
But you live by God's Holy Spirit, if God's Holy Spirit lives in you. If a person does not have God’s Holy Spirit from Jesus, they do not belong to Him. 🏠🕊️
## Romans 8:10
If Jesus is in you, your body will die because of sin, but God's Holy Spirit gives life because God makes you right. ✝️➡️🌿
## Romans 8:11
God raised Jesus from death by God's Holy Spirit. The same Spirit lives in you. He will make your bodies alive too. 🕊️⬆️🪦➡️🌿
## Romans 8:12
So we do not have to obey sin. We do not owe sin. ❌😈
## Romans 8:13
If you live by sin, you will die. But if you say “no” to bad things by God's Holy Spirit, you will live. ✋😈➡️🌿
## Romans 8:14
All who are led by God's Holy Spirit are God’s kids. 🕊️👨‍👩‍👧‍👦
## Romans 8:15
God did not make you slaves who fear. God made you His kids. We call God, “Abba! Father!” 🙌👶 “Abba! Father!”
## Romans 8:16
God's Holy Spirit tells our hearts, “You are God’s kids.” 💬🕊️❤️
## Romans 8:17
If we are God’s kids, we get good things with Jesus. We may have pain with Him now. Later we will share His bright joy. 🎁😢➡️😊✨
## Romans 8:18
Our pain now is small. God’s bright joy later is big. 📉😢 / 📈✨
## Romans 8:19
The world God made waits to see God’s kids. 🌍👀
## Romans 8:20
The world had to feel sad and wait. God let it be, but there is hope. 🌍😔⏳
## Romans 8:21
One day the world God made will be free. It will share the free, bright life of God’s kids. 🌍🔓✨
## Romans 8:22
All the world has pain, like a mom having a baby. 🌍🤰😣
## Romans 8:23
We feel pain too. We have God's Holy Spirit now. We wait for God to make our bodies new, as His kids. 🕊️⏳💪
## Romans 8:24
We are saved, and we hope. We do not see it yet. If we see it, we do not hope. 👀❌➡️🕊️
## Romans 8:25
We hope for what we do not see. So we wait and keep on. ⏳🙏
## Romans 8:26
God's Holy Spirit helps us when we are weak. We do not know how to pray. God's Holy Spirit prays for us with deep cries. 🕊️🤲😢
## Romans 8:27
God sees our hearts. God knows what God's Holy Spirit thinks. The Spirit prays for God’s people in God’s good way. 👀❤️🕊️
## Romans 8:28
We know God works in all things for good for people who love God. He calls them by His plan. 🔄❤️➡️👍
## Romans 8:29
God knew His people before. God planned for them to be like His Son Jesus, so Jesus would be the big Brother. 👦👦➡️👨‍👦
## Romans 8:30
God planned. God called. God made them right. God made them shine with joy. 📞✅✨
## Romans 8:31
So what now? If God is for us, no one can win against us. 🛡️💪
## Romans 8:32
God did not keep back His own Son. God gave Jesus for us all. With Jesus, God will give us all we need. 🎁✝️
## Romans 8:33
Who can say God’s people are bad? God is the One who makes us right. ☝️✅
## Romans 8:34
Who can punish us? Jesus died. Yes, He rose. He is at God’s right side. He prays for us. ✝️⬆️👑🙏
## Romans 8:35
Who can stop God’s love in Jesus? Can big trouble, sad fear, hurt, no food, no coat, danger, or a sword? No. 🚫❤️✝️
## Romans 8:36
The book says, “We may die for You. We are like sheep to be killed.” 🐑⚔️
## Romans 8:37
But in all this we win big by Jesus, who loves us. We win by His love. 🏆❤️
## Romans 8:38
I am sure: Not death, not life, not angels, not big rulers, not now, not later, can stop God’s love. ✅❤️
## Romans 8:39
Not high, not low, not anything God made, can stop God’s love in Jesus our Lord. Nothing. ❤️✝️🙌


## Romans 9:1
Paul says: I tell the truth in Jesus. I do not lie. God's Holy Spirit says this too. ✝️🕊️🗣️
## Romans 9:2
Paul says: My heart hurts. I feel very sad all the time. 💔😢
## Romans 9:3
Paul says: I love my people so much. I would take the bad. I would be cut off from Jesus to help them. ❤️😢✝️
## Romans 9:4
They are Israel. God chose them long ago. God gave them His rules, His house, and His promises. 📜🏠✨
## Romans 9:5
Their big fathers are Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. From them came Jesus as a man. He is over all. Praise God! 👪✝️🙌
## Romans 9:6
God’s word did not fail. Not all in Israel are truly God’s people. 📖✅
## Romans 9:7
Not all kids of Abraham are God’s kids. God said, “In Isaac your kids will be named.” 👶⭐
## Romans 9:8
Kids by body are not all God’s kids. Kids by God’s promise are His family. 👪✨
## Romans 9:9
God said, “I will come. Sarah will have a son.” ⏰👶
## Romans 9:10
Also Rebekah had babies with Isaac, the same dad. 👶👶

Before the twins were born and did no good or bad, God chose. His call does not come from our work. 🍼➡️🙏
## Romans 9:12
God said, “The older will serve the younger.” 👦➡️👶
## Romans 9:13
It says: “I loved Jacob. I did not choose Esau the same.” 💙🤍
## Romans 9:14
Is God not fair? No! God is fair. ❌⚖️✅
## Romans 9:15
God said to Moses, “I will be kind to who I want. I will show pity to who I want.” 👑🤲
## Romans 9:16
So it is not from what we want or do. It is from God, who is kind. 🏃‍♂️❌➡️God✅
## Romans 9:17
God said to Pharaoh: “I put you there to show My power. All will hear My name.” 👑⚡📣
## Romans 9:18
So God is kind to who He wants. He lets some hearts be hard. 💖🤝 / 💔
## Romans 9:19
You may say: “Then why does God blame? Who can stop His plan?” ❓🤔
## Romans 9:20
But who are you to talk back to God? A made thing cannot say, “Why did you make me so?” 🗿🙊
## Romans 9:21
A pot maker can shape clay. He can make one nice jar and one plain jar. 🏺👐
## Romans 9:22
What if God waits with patience for bad jars ready to break, to show His power? ⏳🏺💥
## Romans 9:23
And He wants to show His rich good to kind jars He made ready. 🌟🏺😊
## Romans 9:24
We are those He called, from Jews and from other people too. 🧑‍🤝‍🧑🌍
## Romans 9:25
God said by Hosea: “I will call not-My-people, My people. I will call not-loved, Loved.” 🗣️➡️💞
## Romans 9:26
In the same place He said, “You are not My people,” there they will be called kids of the living God. 📍➡️👨‍👩‍👧‍👦🧡
## Romans 9:27
Isaiah said about Israel: They are many like sand, but only a small group will be saved. 🏖️👥➡️👥

The Lord will finish His work fast and right on the earth. ⚡🌍✅
## Romans 9:29
Isaiah said: If the Lord had not left us some people, we would be like Sodom and Gomorrah. 🌧️🔥
## Romans 9:30
What do we say? Other people did not try by rules. But they became right with God by trust. 🚫📜➡️🤝God
## Romans 9:31
But Israel tried to be right by rules. They did not get there. 📜➡️🚫
## Romans 9:32
Why? They did not trust. They tried by works. They tripped on the Stone. 🚶‍♂️🪨😣
## Romans 9:33
God says: “I put a Stone in Zion. People trip. But all who trust in Him will not be let down.” 🪨✝️💪


## Romans 10:1
Paul said, “Friends, I pray to God for the Israel people. I want them to be saved.” 🙏❤️
## Romans 10:2
Paul said, “They try very hard for God, but they do not know the right way.” 😕
## Romans 10:3
“They do not know God’s way to be right. They make their own way. They do not say yes to God’s way.” 🚫➡️
## Romans 10:4
“Jesus finished the rule way. Now we are right with God when we trust Him.” ✝️✅
## Romans 10:5
“Moses wrote, ‘If you keep all the rules, you will live by them.’” 📜📘
## Romans 10:6
“But the way of trust says, ‘Do not think, Who will go up to the sky to bring Jesus down?’” ☁️⬆️⬇️
## Romans 10:7
“Or, ‘Who will go down into the deep to bring Jesus up from the dead?’” 🕳️⬇️🌅
## Romans 10:8
“What does it say? The good news is near. It is in your mouth and in your heart. We tell this good news.” 👄❤️👂
## Romans 10:9
“Say with your mouth, ‘Jesus is my boss.’ Believe in your heart God made Him alive again. Then you will be saved.” 🗣️❤️✝️
## Romans 10:10
“You believe with your heart, and God makes you right. You say it with your mouth, and God saves you.” ❤️👄🙏
## Romans 10:11
“The Bible says, ‘All who trust in Him will not be let down. God will not say they are bad.’” 📖😊
## Romans 10:12
“God treats all the same. Jesus is boss of all. He is kind to all who call to Him.” 🌍🤝
## Romans 10:13
“All who call to Jesus will be saved.” 📞✝️
## Romans 10:14
“But how can they call to Him if they do not trust Him? How can they trust if they never heard? How can they hear if no one tells?” ❓👂🗣️
## Romans 10:15
“And who will tell if they are not sent? The Bible says, ‘How pretty are the feet of people who bring good news!’” 👣💌
## Romans 10:16
“But not all people listen to the good news. Isaiah said, ‘God, who believed what we said?’” 🙉
## Romans 10:17
“So trust comes when we hear. We hear the message about Jesus.” 👂➡️❤️
## Romans 10:18
“Did they not hear? Yes, they did. The message went to all the earth. The words went to the ends of the world.” 🌎📣
## Romans 10:19
“Did Israel not get it? Moses said first, ‘I will make you feel jealous by a people not your group. I will make you feel mad by a people who do not know much.’” 😮‍💨😠
## Romans 10:20
“Isaiah said, ‘People who did not look for God found Him. God showed Himself to people who did not ask.’” 👀✨
## Romans 10:21
“But about Israel, God said, ‘All day long I held out My hands to people who would not listen and would not obey.’” 🤲🕰️


## Romans 11:1
Paul says, “Did God say no to His people?” No! I am from Israel. I am from Abraham’s big family. I am from Benjamin. 🙋‍♂️🇮🇱✨
## Romans 11:2
God did not say no to His first people. Long ago, Elijah talked to God about Israel. 🙏🇮🇱
## Romans 11:3
Elijah said, “They hurt Your helpers. They broke Your places to pray. I am alone. They want to hurt me.” 😢🏚️
## Romans 11:4
God said to Elijah, “I kept 7,000 people. They did not bow to a fake god.” 🙌7️⃣0️⃣0️⃣0️⃣
## Romans 11:5
So now, some people are left for God. God chose them because He is kind. 🌟❤️
## Romans 11:6
If God chose by being kind, then it is not by our work. If it is by work, it is not by kind gift. 🎁🚫💼
## Romans 11:7
Most in Israel did not get what they wanted. The ones God chose did. The rest got hard hearts. 💔
## Romans 11:8
It says: God let them be sleepy. Eyes did not see. Ears did not hear. It is still like this. 😴🙈🙉
## Romans 11:9
David said: Their table became a trap. It made them fall. 🍽️🪤
## Romans 11:10
Their eyes got dark. Their backs bent all the time. 🌑😣
## Romans 11:11
Paul says, “Did they fall and never get up?” No! When they did wrong, other people got saved. This makes Israel want God too. ✝️🌍➡️🇮🇱
## Romans 11:12
If their wrong gave good things to the world, how much more good when they come back! ➕✨
## Romans 11:13
Paul talks to other people: “God sent me to you. I am happy to help you.” 🗣️🌍😊
## Romans 11:14
“I hope my own people see and want God. I hope some will be saved.” 🇮🇱👀❤️
## Romans 11:15
If their “no” helped the world be friends with God, their “yes” will be like life from the dead. 🌎🤝✨
## Romans 11:16
If the first part is clean and special for God, the rest is too. If the root is clean and special for God, the branches are too. 🌱🌿
## Romans 11:17
Some branches were cut off. You, a wild branch, were put in. Now you share the good food from the root. 🌿✂️➡️🌳
## Romans 11:18
Do not brag to the old branches. You do not hold the root. The root holds you. 🙅‍♂️🌳
## Romans 11:19
You may say, “Branches were cut off so I could be put in.” 💭🌿
## Romans 11:20
Yes, but they were cut off because they did not trust God. You stand because you trust. Do not be proud. Be careful. 🙏⚠️
## Romans 11:21
If God did not let the first branches stay when they did not trust, He may not let you stay if you turn away. ✂️🌿
## Romans 11:22
See both: God is kind, and God is strict. He was strict to the ones who fell. He is kind to you if you stay with His kind way. If not, you will be cut off too. 😊⚖️
## Romans 11:23
And they can be put in again if they stop not-trusting. God can put them in again. 🔁🌿
## Romans 11:24
You were cut from a wild tree and put into a good tree. If God did that for you, He can put the real branches back in their own tree. 🌳🔁
## Romans 11:25
I do not want you to think you are wise. Part of Israel is hard now, until many other people come in. 🧠🚫⏳
## Romans 11:26
Then many in Israel will be saved. It says: The Saver will come from Zion. He will take away bad from Jacob. 🛟⛰️
## Romans 11:27
God says: This is My promise to them. I will take away their bad. 📜❤️
## Romans 11:28
Now, about the good news, they fight it, so you can get it. But God still loves them because of their fathers. 📖❤️
## Romans 11:29
God does not take back His gifts and His call. 🎁🔒
## Romans 11:30
You did not obey before. Now God was kind to you because they did not obey. 🔄❤️
## Romans 11:31
Now they do not obey. Soon they can get mercy too, because God was kind to you. 🤝❤️
## Romans 11:32
God let all do wrong, so He can show mercy to all. 🌍❤️
## Romans 11:33
Wow! God is so rich in wisdom and know-how. We cannot see all His ways. 😮✨
## Romans 11:34
Who knows God’s mind? Who can tell God what to do? 🤔❓
## Romans 11:35
Who gave to God first, so God must pay back? No one. 🙅‍♂️🎁
## Romans 11:36
All things come from Him, by Him, and for Him. Give Him praise forever. Amen. 🌟🙌


## Romans 12:1
Paul says: Friends, give your life to God. Use your body to do good for God. This makes God glad. 🙏❤️🙌

Paul says: Do not copy the bad world. Let God make your mind new. Then you can see what God wants. It is good. 🚫🌍🧠✨
## Romans 12:3
Paul says: Do not act big. Be small and kind. Trust God. God gives each one what they need. 🙇‍♀️🤝🙏
## Romans 12:4
Paul says: Your body has many parts. Each part has a job. 🧍‍♂️🖐️👣
## Romans 12:5
Paul says: We are many people. With Jesus we are one team. We need each other. He makes us one. 👥✝️🤝
## Romans 12:6
Paul says: God gives each one a special gift. Use your gift. If you speak God’s word, do it with trust in God. 🎁🗣️📖
## Romans 12:7
Paul says: If you help, then help. If you teach, then teach. 🤝📚
## Romans 12:8
Paul says: If you cheer people, then cheer. If you give, give a lot. If you are a leader, be a good boss. If you care for hurt people, do it with joy. 📣🎁👑💗
## Romans 12:9
Paul says: Let love be real. Hate bad. Hold on to good. ❤️🚫😈✅
## Romans 12:10

## Romans 12:17
Paul says: Do not hit back. Do what is good so all can see. ✋🚫🔁👀👍
## Romans 12:18
Paul says: Do your best to live with no fights with all people. 🕊️🌍🙂
## Romans 12:19
Paul says: Dear ones, do not pay back. Let God handle it. God will make it right. 💖✋⚖️
## Romans 12:20
Paul says: If a not-nice person is hungry, give food. If thirsty, give water. Your kind acts can warm the heart. 🍞💧🤝❤️
## Romans 12:21
Paul says: Do not let bad win. Win over bad with good. 🚫😈✅💖🏆


## Romans 13:1
Paul told all people: obey the leaders in the land. God put leaders there. 🏛️🙏
## Romans 13:2
If you fight the leaders, you fight what God set up. If you fight, you will get in trouble. ⚠️🚫
## Romans 13:3
Rulers are not scary if you do good. Do good, and the leader will say good job. 👍😊
## Romans 13:4
The leader works for God to help you. But if you do bad, be afraid. He can punish bad people. 👮‍♂️⚖️
## Romans 13:5
So you must obey, not just to skip trouble, but because your heart knows it is right. ❤️✅
## Romans 13:6
This is why you pay tax. Leaders serve God and work to keep order. 💰🧾
## Romans 13:7
Give to all what you owe: tax, money, respect, and honor. 🤝💵
## Romans 13:8
Do not owe anyone, except to love each other. If you love, you keep God’s rules. ❤️🤗
## Romans 13:9
God’s rules say: do not break your big promise, do not kill, do not steal, do not want what is not yours. All these say: love your neighbor like you love you. 📜🏘️❤️
## Romans 13:10
Love does no harm to a neighbor. So love keeps God’s rules. 🛡️❤️
## Romans 13:11
Do this now. Wake up! God will save us soon. It is closer than before. ⏰🌅
## Romans 13:12
Night is almost gone. Day is near. Say no to dark bad acts. Put on light good ways. 🌙➡️☀️✨
## Romans 13:13
Live good like in the day. Do not do wild bad party stuff. Do not drink too much. Do not be mean or fight. Do not be jealous. 🚫🍻🙂🤝
## Romans 13:14
Wear Jesus like new clean clothes. Follow Him. Do not plan to feed bad body wants. 👕✝️🚫


## Romans 14:1
Paul says, welcome the weak friend. Be nice. Do not fight about what they think. 🤝❤️🙅‍♂️
## Romans 14:2
One person eats all food. Another eats only veggies. 🍎🥦🍞
## Romans 14:3
If you eat, do not be mean to the one who will not eat. If you do not eat, do not say bad things to the one who eats. God welcomes both. 🍽️❌❤️
## Romans 14:4
You are not their boss. The Lord is their boss. The Lord can help them stand. 🚫👆🙏
## Romans 14:5
One person makes a day special. Another says all days are the same. Each one should be sure inside. 📅⭐🧠
## Romans 14:6
If someone keeps a special day, they do it for the Lord. If someone eats, they thank God. If someone does not eat, they still do it for the Lord and thank God. 🙌🍞🙏
## Romans 14:7
We do not live just for self. We do not die just for self. 🚶‍♂️❤️
## Romans 14:8
If we live, we live for the Lord. If we die, we die for the Lord. We are the Lord’s. ⛪🙏💖
## Romans 14:9
Jesus died and came back to life. He is Lord of people who live and people who died. ✝️🕊️🌅
## Romans 14:10
Do not say bad things to a brother or sister. Do not look down on them. All of us will stand before God. 🚫🗣️👫🙏
## Romans 14:11
The Lord says: every knee will bend to Me. Every mouth will say God is God. 🙇‍♂️👄✨
## Romans 14:12
Each one of us will tell God what we did. 🗣️📖🙏
## Romans 14:13
So do not pick on each other. Make a choice to not make a friend do wrong. 🚫👉🤝
## Romans 14:14
Paul says: with the Lord Jesus, I know all food is okay. But if a person thinks some food is not okay, then for that person it is not okay. 🍗✅❌
## Romans 14:15
If your food makes a friend sad, you are not living in God’s love. Do not hurt a friend with food. Jesus died for that friend. 🍽️😢❤️✝️
## Romans 14:16
Do not let people call your good thing bad. 👍🚫👎
## Romans 14:17
God’s way is not about food or drink. It is about doing right, peace, and joy with God’s Holy Spirit. 🍽️➡️🕊️😊
## Romans 14:18
If you live this way for Jesus, God is glad. People see it and say it is good. 🙌😊👀
## Romans 14:19
So let us try for peace. Let us help each other grow strong. 🕊️🤝💪
## Romans 14:20
Do not stop God’s good work for food. All food is okay. But it is bad to make a friend do wrong by what you eat. 🍽️🚫💔
## Romans 14:21
It is best to not eat meat, or drink wine (grape drink), or do any thing that makes a friend do wrong. 🥩🚫🍷🚫
## Romans 14:22
Keep your trust with God in your heart. You are happy if you do not feel bad about what you think is okay. ❤️🙏😊
## Romans 14:23
If you are not sure and you eat, it is not from trust. If it is not from trust, it is wrong. 🤔🍽️❌


## Romans 15:1
We who are strong must help the weak and not just make self happy. 🤝💪
## Romans 15:2
Each one of you help your neighbor so they get strong and good. 🧱❤️
## Romans 15:3
Jesus did not live to make Himself happy; bad words to God fell on Him. ✝️🙅‍♂️
## Romans 15:4
The old book helps us learn and gives us hope as we wait. 📖🌟
## Romans 15:5
May God help all of you think the same and get along like Jesus wants. 🙏🤗
## Romans 15:6
Then all of you can thank God the Father with one big voice. 🙌🎶
## Romans 15:7
So welcome each other, like Jesus welcomed you, to show how good God is. 🤗❤️
## Romans 15:8
Jesus came to serve the Jews and to show God keeps His word. ✝️📜
## Romans 15:9
Then people who are not Jews will say thank You to God; the book says, I will sing to You with the nations. 🌍🎵
## Romans 15:10
Be glad, other nations, with His people. 😀🎉
## Romans 15:11
All nations, praise the Lord; all people, say big thanks to Him. 🙌🌎
## Romans 15:12
The prophet Isaiah said, A Son from Jesse will come; He will lead other nations, and they will hope in Him. 🌱👑
## Romans 15:13
May God fill you with joy and peace as you trust Him; by God's Holy Spirit your hope will grow big. 😊🕊️🌟
## Romans 15:14
Paul says, I think you are full of good and can help teach each other. 👍👥
## Romans 15:15
I wrote strong words to help you remember; God gave me this job. ✍️🙏
## Romans 15:16
God made me a worker for Jesus to people who are not Jews; I tell the good news so they can give their lives to God; God's Holy Spirit makes them clean. 📣🕊️
## Romans 15:17
I am glad in Jesus for what God did. ✝️😊
## Romans 15:18
I talk only about what Jesus did by me; He helped other nations obey by my words and my acts. 🗣️🤲
## Romans 15:19
God did big power works by God's Holy Spirit; I told people about Jesus from Jerusalem to Illyricum. 🌍⚡🕊️
## Romans 15:20
I try to go where people do not know Jesus yet. 🗺️🚶
## Romans 15:21
The book says, People who did not hear will see; people who did not know will learn. 👀📖
## Romans 15:22
This is why I could not come to you before. ⏳
## Romans 15:23
Now my work here is done, and I wanted to see you for many years. 🧭💌
## Romans 15:24
I plan to visit you on my way to Spain; please help me, and I will be happy to see you. 🧳➡️🇪🇸
## Romans 15:25
But now I go to Jerusalem to help God's people. 🛤️🤝
## Romans 15:26
The people in Macedonia and Achaia gave gifts for the poor in Jerusalem. 🎁💖
## Romans 15:27
They were glad to give; they got good things from the Jews, so they should share money and care. 💞💵
## Romans 15:28
After I give the gift, I will go to Spain and stop by to see you. 📦➡️🇪🇸
## Romans 15:29
I know I will come with Jesus’ big blessing. 🎁✝️
## Romans 15:30
Friends, I ask you by our Lord Jesus Christ and by God's Holy Spirit to pray hard with me. 🙏🕊️
## Romans 15:31
Pray God keeps me safe from people in Judea who do not believe, and that the gift is good for God's people in Jerusalem. 🛡️📦
## Romans 15:32
Then, if God wants, I will come to you with joy and rest with you. 😀🛌
## Romans 15:33
May the God of peace be with all of you. Amen. 🕊️

Some of you say, “I am with Paul.” Others say, “I am with Apollos,” or “I am with Peter,” or “I am with Christ.” 🧍🧍‍♂️🧍‍♀️➡️
## 1 Corinthians 1:13
Is Christ split into parts? Did Paul die on a cross for you? Were you put in water in Paul’s name? ❓✝️🚫
## 1 Corinthians 1:14
I thank God I only put in water Crispus and Gaius. 🙏💧
## 1 Corinthians 1:15
I did this so no one can say you were put in water in my name. 🚫🏷️
## 1 Corinthians 1:16
I also put in water the family of Stephanas. I do not remember if I put in water anyone else. 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦💧
## 1 Corinthians 1:17
Christ sent me to tell the good news, not to use big fancy words, so the cross of Christ shows real power. 📣✝️⚡
## 1 Corinthians 1:18
Some people think the cross is silly. We who are saved know the cross is God’s power. 🤔✝️💥
## 1 Corinthians 1:19
God says, “I will stop the smart talk of the smart people.” ✋🧠
## 1 Corinthians 1:20
Where are the smart ones and the big talkers now? God made the world’s smart ways look silly. 🧐🤷
## 1 Corinthians 1:21
People did not find God by being smart. God uses simple good news to save people who trust Him. 🗣️➡️💖
## 1 Corinthians 1:22
Some Jews want big signs. Some Greeks want smart ideas. ✨🧠
## 1 Corinthians 1:23
We tell about Christ on the cross. Some Jews trip on this. Many non-Jews think it is silly. ✝️🧱🤷
## 1 Corinthians 1:24
But to people God calls, Jews and Greeks, Christ is God’s power and God’s wisdom. ✝️⚡🧠
## 1 Corinthians 1:25
God’s “silly” is wiser than people. God’s “weak” is stronger than people. 💡💪
## 1 Corinthians 1:26
Look at you. Not many of you are very smart, or strong, or important. 👀🙂
## 1 Corinthians 1:27
God chose people the world calls silly to show the smart are wrong. God chose weak ones to show the strong are wrong. 🔄
## 1 Corinthians 1:28
God chose people others look down on, even people no one sees, to stop the proud. 🌱👀
## 1 Corinthians 1:29
So no one can brag to God. 🚫😤
## 1 Corinthians 1:30
God put you in Christ Jesus. Jesus is our wisdom. He makes us right. He makes us clean and free. 🙌🧼🕊️
## 1 Corinthians 1:31
If you brag, brag about the Lord. Point to Him. 📣➡️🙏


## 1 Corinthians 2:1
Paul says: Friends, when I came to you, I did not use big, smart talk. I told you God’s good news in simple words. 🗣️❤️
## 1 Corinthians 2:2
Paul says: I wanted to talk about one thing only: Jesus Christ. He died on a cross. ✝️
## 1 Corinthians 2:3
Paul says: I was weak. I was afraid. I shook. 😟😰
## 1 Corinthians 2:4
Paul says: My words were not big, smart words. God’s Holy Spirit showed power. 🕊️⚡
## 1 Corinthians 2:5
Paul says: I wanted your trust to be in God’s power, not in people’s smart words. 💪🙏
## 1 Corinthians 2:6
Paul says: We do teach some grown-ups. But it is not the smart of this world. The big bosses now will not last. 🧑‍🏫🌍⏳
## 1 Corinthians 2:7
Paul says: We tell God’s secret plan. God set this plan long ago. It is for our good. 🤫📖🕰️❤️
## 1 Corinthians 2:8
Paul says: The big bosses did not get it. If they did, they would not put the Lord Jesus on a cross. 👑✝️
## 1 Corinthians 2:9
It says: No eye saw it. No ear heard it. No one thought it. God made good things for the ones who love Him. 👀🚫👂🚫🧠🚫🎁❤️
## 1 Corinthians 2:10
God shows these things to us by God’s Holy Spirit. God’s Holy Spirit looks in all things, even deep things of God. 🕊️🔎🌊
## 1 Corinthians 2:11
Only a person knows his own thoughts inside. In the same way, only God’s Holy Spirit knows God’s thoughts. 🧠🔒🕊️
## 1 Corinthians 2:12
We did not get the spirit of this world. We got God’s Holy Spirit. So we can know the gifts God gives us. 🌍🚫🕊️✅🎁
## 1 Corinthians 2:13
We teach with words from God’s Holy Spirit, not from people. We share God things with people who have God’s Holy Spirit. 🗣️🕊️🤝
## 1 Corinthians 2:14
A person without God’s Holy Spirit does not take these God things. It seems silly to him. He cannot get it. 🙅‍♂️🤔❌
## 1 Corinthians 2:15
A person with God’s Holy Spirit can look at many things and see what is right. Other people cannot judge him. 👀✅🕊️🛡️
## 1 Corinthians 2:16
No one can tell the Lord what to think. But we can think like Jesus Christ. 🧠✨


## 1 Corinthians 3:1
Paul says: I could not talk to you all like big, God-strong people. I had to talk like babies in Jesus. 🗣️👶✝️
## 1 Corinthians 3:2
I gave you milk, not hard food, because you were not ready. You are still not ready. 🍼🚫🍞
## 1 Corinthians 3:3
You still fuss and fight. You want to be first. This is not God’s way. 😠🤼‍♂️🚫
## 1 Corinthians 3:4
Some of you say, “I am with Paul.” Some say, “I am with Apollos.” You are picking teams. 🙋‍♂️➡️Paul | 🙋‍♀️➡️Apollos 🏷️
## 1 Corinthians 3:5
Who are Paul and Apollos? We are helpers. God gave each a job so you could trust Him. 🤝🧰🙏
## 1 Corinthians 3:6
I planted the seed. Apollos gave water. God made it grow. 🌱💧⬆️
## 1 Corinthians 3:7
The planter is not big. The water helper is not big. God makes it grow. 🙏🌱
## 1 Corinthians 3:8
The planter and the water helper are one team. God will give each one a good thank-you for the work. 👥🤝✅🎁
## 1 Corinthians 3:9
We work with God. You all are like God’s farm and God’s house. 🚜🌾🏠
## 1 Corinthians 3:10
God helped me. I was like a good builder. I put down the base. Others build on it. Be careful how you build. 🧱🛠️🏗️⚠️
## 1 Corinthians 3:11
No one can make a new base. The base is Jesus. Jesus is God’s Son. Jesus loves us. ✝️🧱❤️
## 1 Corinthians 3:12
Some build with gold, silver, and jewels. Some build with wood, hay, and straw. 🪙🥈💎🪵🌾🧺
## 1 Corinthians 3:13
One day, the work will show what it is. Fire will test it. 🔥🔎
## 1 Corinthians 3:14
If the building stands, the builder gets a good gift. 🏠💪🎁
## 1 Corinthians 3:15
If it burns up, the builder loses the work. He is still safe with God, but it is hard. 🔥😢🙏
## 1 Corinthians 3:16
Do you know? You are God’s temple, God’s house. God’s Holy Spirit lives in you all. 🏠✨🕊️
## 1 Corinthians 3:17
If anyone hurts God’s temple, God will stop that person. God’s temple is holy. You all are that temple. ⚠️✋🏠✨
## 1 Corinthians 3:18
Do not trick yourself. If you think you are very smart, be simple and learn God’s way. 🧠➡️🙂📚
## 1 Corinthians 3:19
World smart is silly to God. God stops tricky plans. 🌍🤪✋
## 1 Corinthians 3:20
The Lord knows what smart people think. Their plans are empty to Him. 👑🧠🫙
## 1 Corinthians 3:21
So do not brag about people. God gives you all you need. 🚫😤➡️🙂🎁
## 1 Corinthians 3:22
Paul, Apollos, Peter, the world, life, death, now, and later—God uses all for you. 🧑‍🏫🧑‍🏫🧔🌍🌤️⚰️📅⏳
## 1 Corinthians 3:23
You belong to Jesus. Jesus belongs to God. ✝️➡️👥➡️👑


## 1 Corinthians 4:1
Paul said, “See us as Jesus’ helpers. We work for Him. We share God’s good things.” 🙋‍♂️✝️📖
## 1 Corinthians 4:2
God’s helpers must be true and do good work. 👍🧰
## 1 Corinthians 4:3
It is not big to me if you or people say I am bad or good. I do not judge me. 🚫⚖️🙂
## 1 Corinthians 4:4
I do not see wrong in me, but that does not make me right. The Lord will judge me. 👀➡️⚖️
## 1 Corinthians 4:5
Do not judge now. Wait for the Lord. He will show what is dark and what is in hearts. Then God will say, “Good job,” to each one. ⏳🌟❤️
## 1 Corinthians 4:6
I used me and Apollos to teach all of you: Do not go past the book. Do not pick one man and be proud. 📖🙅‍♂️💬
## 1 Corinthians 4:7
All you have is a gift. You got it from God. So do not brag. 🎁🙏🚫
## 1 Corinthians 4:8
You act like you have all you want. You act rich and like kings. I wish we were kings with you too. 👑🍞🤷‍♂️
## 1 Corinthians 4:9
God shows us, His helpers, like last, like men to die. All watch us, people and angels. 🕊️➡️⚠️👀
## 1 Corinthians 4:10
We look silly for Jesus. You look smart. We are weak. You are strong. People like you, not us. 🤡💪➡️😔
## 1 Corinthians 4:11
We are hungry and thirsty. We are in bad clothes. We are hit. We have no home. 🍞🚫🥤🚫🥶🏚️
## 1 Corinthians 4:12
We work hard with our hands. When people say bad to us, we say good. When hurt, we keep going. ✋🛠️🙂➡️💔🏃‍♂️
## 1 Corinthians 4:13
When people lie about us, we talk nice. People treat us like trash of the world. 🗣️❤️🗑️🌍
## 1 Corinthians 4:14
I do not say this to shame you. I talk like a dad to kids I love. 👨‍👧‍👦❤️
## 1 Corinthians 4:15
You have many helpers, but not many dads. In Jesus, I am like your dad. I told you the good news. 👨‍👧‍👦✝️🗞️
## 1 Corinthians 4:16
So I ask you, please copy me. 👣🙂
## 1 Corinthians 4:17
I sent Timothy, my loved and true son in the Lord. He will help you remember how I live in Jesus. I teach the same in every church. 🧑‍🦱✉️⛪
## 1 Corinthians 4:18
Some of you act big and proud. You think I will not come. 😠🗣️
## 1 Corinthians 4:19
I will come soon, if the Lord lets me. I will see what these big talk men can do, not just say. 🗓️🚶‍♂️⚡
## 1 Corinthians 4:20
God’s way is not just talk. It has power. 🕊️💥
## 1 Corinthians 4:21
What do you want? Should I come with a stick, or with love and a soft way? 🪵❓❤️🤗


## 1 Corinthians 5:1
Paul says: I hear a very bad thing. A man is with his dad’s wife. This is very, very wrong. 😱
## 1 Corinthians 5:2
Paul says: You all are proud. You should be sad and cry. You should put the man out. 😠😢🚪
## 1 Corinthians 5:3
Paul says: I am not with you in my body. But I am with you in my spirit. I have made a choice about this man. ✍️👀
## 1 Corinthians 5:4
Paul says: When you all meet, do this by the name of the Lord Jesus. I am with you in spirit. Jesus gives power. ⛪🙏✝️⚡
## 1 Corinthians 5:5
Paul says: Put the man out. Let Satan hurt his body, so his spirit can be saved when the Lord Jesus comes. 🚫👤🔥🩹✝️
## 1 Corinthians 5:6
Paul says: Your brag is not good. A little yeast makes all the dough rise. ❌🗣️🍞⬆️
## 1 Corinthians 5:7
Paul says: Get out the old yeast. Be new bread with no yeast. Jesus is our Passover Lamb. He died for us. 🧹🍞❌🐑✝️
## 1 Corinthians 5:8
Paul says: So let us keep God’s party. Not with old yeast of mean and bad. But with clean bread of clean and true. 🎉🍞🤍
## 1 Corinthians 5:9
Paul says: I wrote to you before. Do not stay close with people who do very wrong with their bodies. 📜🚫👥
## 1 Corinthians 5:10
Paul says: I did not mean the people of the world who do wrong, or want too much, or cheat, or pray to fake gods. If so, you all would have to leave the world. 🌍💭💰🙅🗿
## 1 Corinthians 5:11
Paul says: Now I say this: If a person says, “I am a Jesus friend,” but does very wrong, or wants too much, or prays to fake gods, or is mean with words, or drinks too much, or cheats—do not be close. Do not even eat with him. ✝️🗣️🚫🍽️
## 1 Corinthians 5:12
Paul says: I do not judge people outside the church. You all must look at people inside. 🏠👀
## 1 Corinthians 5:13
Paul says: God will judge people outside. You all must take the bad man out from you. ⚖️➡️🚪


## 1 Corinthians 6:1
Paul said: When you all fight, do not go to a bad court. Ask God’s people in the church to help. ⚖️🚫⛪
## 1 Corinthians 6:2
Paul said: You all will help God judge the world one day. So you can fix small fights now. 🌍⚖️🔧
## 1 Corinthians 6:3
Paul said: You all will even help judge angels. So you can fix life stuff too. 😇⚖️🛠️
## 1 Corinthians 6:4
Paul said: When you all have a case, do not pick people who do not love God to judge. Pick church helpers. 🧑‍⚖️🚫⛪👍
## 1 Corinthians 6:5
Paul said: I say this to make you think. Is there no wise person there to help two brothers? 🤔👦👦⛪
## 1 Corinthians 6:6
Paul said: But one brother goes to court with another brother, in front of people who do not know God. ⚖️👥🙈
## 1 Corinthians 6:7
Paul said: These fights are already a big loss. It is better to take a loss. It is better to be hurt than to fight. 😞➡️🤝
## 1 Corinthians 6:8
Paul said: But you all do wrong. You all cheat your own church family. 😠🤦‍♂️👨‍👩‍👧‍👦
## 1 Corinthians 6:9
Paul said: Bad people will not be in God’s good Kingdom. Do not be tricked. People who do bad body things, or bow to idols, or break a home, or do other bad body sins will not be in. 🛑👑🗿
## 1 Corinthians 6:10
Paul said: People who steal, or are greedy, or get drunk, or say mean words, or trick others will not be in God’s Kingdom. 🛑💰🍺🗣️😡
## 1 Corinthians 6:11
Paul said: Some of you were like that. But God made you clean. God made you His. God made you right by the name of the Lord Jesus. God did this by God’s Holy Spirit. ✝️🧼✨🕊️
## 1 Corinthians 6:12
Paul said: Some say, “I can do all things.” But not all things help. I will not let any thing be my boss. 🗣️➡️🧠🚫⛓️
## 1 Corinthians 6:13
Paul said: Food is for the belly, and the belly is for food, but God will end them. Your body is for the Lord. Do not use your body for wrong. 🍞🍽️➡️🧍‍♂️✝️🚫
## 1 Corinthians 6:14
Paul said: God raised the Lord Jesus. God will raise us too by His power. ✝️🌅🆙💪
## 1 Corinthians 6:15
Paul said: Your bodies belong to Christ. I will not join Christ’s body parts to a bad body sin person. No! 🙅‍♂️🧍‍♂️➡️✝️🚫
## 1 Corinthians 6:16
Paul said: If a man joins a bad body sin person, they become one body. God says, “The two become one.” 🧍‍♂️➕🧍‍♀️=1
## 1 Corinthians 6:17
Paul said: If you join the Lord, you are one with Him. ✝️❤️1
## 1 Corinthians 6:18
Paul said: Run away from body sin. Other sin is outside the body. Body sin hurts your own body. 🏃‍♂️💨🧍‍♂️🚫
## 1 Corinthians 6:19
Paul said: Do you know? Your body is a home for God’s Holy Spirit. He lives in you. God gave Him to you. You do not belong only to you. 🏠🕊️🧍‍♂️
## 1 Corinthians 6:20
Paul said: God paid to buy you. So use your body to make God happy. 🙏😊🧍‍♂️✨


## 1 Corinthians 7:1
Paul said to the church: You asked me. It is good for a man to stay single. 🙂👍
## 1 Corinthians 7:2
But to help stop wrong, each man should have his own wife, and each woman should have her own husband. 💑✅
## 1 Corinthians 7:3
A husband should be kind and close to his wife. A wife should be kind and close to her husband. 🤝❤️
## 1 Corinthians 7:4
The wife's body belongs to her husband. The husband's body belongs to his wife. They share. 👩‍❤️‍👨🔁
## 1 Corinthians 7:5
Do not say no to each other for long. Only stop for a short time if you both agree to pray. Then be close again, so the devil will not tempt you. ⏳🙏🔄🛡️
## 1 Corinthians 7:6
Paul said: This is help, not a rule. 📝👍
## 1 Corinthians 7:7
Paul said: I wish you all were like me and single. But God gives each one a gift. 🙂🎁
## 1 Corinthians 7:8
Paul said to single people and widows: It is good to stay single like me. 👤👍
## 1 Corinthians 7:9
But if they cannot wait, they should marry. It is better to marry than to feel a strong want. 💍🔥➡️💍
## 1 Corinthians 7:10
Paul said: This is a rule from the Lord. A wife should not leave her husband. 📜✝️🚫
## 1 Corinthians 7:11
But if she does leave, she should stay single or go back to her husband. A husband should not leave his wife. ↔️💔➡️🙅‍♂️
## 1 Corinthians 7:12
Paul said: This is me, not a rule from the Lord. If a man follows Jesus and his wife does not, but she wants to stay, he should not leave her. 🙋‍♂️✝️❤️🏠
## 1 Corinthians 7:13
If a woman follows Jesus and her husband does not, but he wants to stay, she should not leave him. 🙋‍♀️✝️❤️🏠
## 1 Corinthians 7:14
God sees the home as clean because one person follows Jesus. The kids are clean to God. 🏠✨👶
## 1 Corinthians 7:15
But if the one who does not follow Jesus leaves, let them go. You are not tied. God calls you to peace. 🚪➡️🕊️
## 1 Corinthians 7:16
Wife, you do not know if you can help your husband follow Jesus. Husband, you do not know if you can help your wife follow Jesus. ❓❤️✝️
## 1 Corinthians 7:17
Each one should live the life the Lord gave. Paul teaches this in every church. 🚶‍♀️🚶‍♂️🙏⛪
## 1 Corinthians 7:18
If you had a body mark when God called you, stay as you are. If you did not, stay as you are. 🩹➡️🙂
## 1 Corinthians 7:19
The body mark does not matter. Obey God. That matters. ✋➕❤️
## 1 Corinthians 7:20
Stay with the life you had when God called you. 🏠🛠️
## 1 Corinthians 7:21
If you were a worker not free when God called you, do not worry. But if you can be free, take it. 🛠️⛓️🙂➡️🔓
## 1 Corinthians 7:22
If you were not free, Jesus makes you free inside. If you were free, you serve Jesus. 💖🔓✝️🧎
## 1 Corinthians 7:23
Jesus paid a price for you. Do not become a slave to people. 💰✝️🙅‍♂️⛓️
## 1 Corinthians 7:24
Brothers and sisters, stay with God where you are. 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦🙏
## 1 Corinthians 7:25
About people not married yet: Paul has no rule from the Lord. He gives his best help. God helps Paul be wise. 🧒❌💍➡️🗣️🙏
## 1 Corinthians 7:26
Times are hard now. So it is good to stay as you are. ⏰⚠️🙂
## 1 Corinthians 7:27
Are you married? Do not try to leave. Are you not married? Do not try to marry. 💍🙌🚫
## 1 Corinthians 7:28
But if you do marry, you did not do wrong. Yet married life can be hard. Paul wants to help you. 💍✅😓🤝
## 1 Corinthians 7:29
Brothers and sisters, time is short. Do not let marriage stop you from serving Jesus. ⏳⛪✝️
## 1 Corinthians 7:30
Do not stay stuck in sad or happy or buying stuff. Hold it light. 😢🙂🛍️👐
## 1 Corinthians 7:31
Do not hold tight to this world. This world will pass. 🌍👐⏳
## 1 Corinthians 7:32
Paul wants you to have no worry. A single man can focus on the Lord and how to please Him. 🙂👤🙏❤️
## 1 Corinthians 7:33
A married man thinks about his home and how to please his wife. 🏠💭😊
## 1 Corinthians 7:34
A single woman can think about God and being good in body and inside. A married woman thinks about her home and how to please her husband. 👩👤🙏💖 | 👩💍🏠😊
## 1 Corinthians 7:35
Paul says this to help you, not to trap you. He wants you to serve the Lord with all your heart. 💬🧡✝️
## 1 Corinthians 7:36
If a man feels he should marry the girl he wants, and they both really want, let them marry. It is not wrong. 👦❤️👧💍✅
## 1 Corinthians 7:37
But if a man can wait and has control, and he chooses not to marry, that is good too. ⏳🙂👍
## 1 Corinthians 7:38
So the one who marries does well. The one who does not marry does even better in these hard times. 💍👍➡️⏰✨
## 1 Corinthians 7:39
A wife stays with her husband while he lives. If he dies, she is free to marry a man who follows the Lord. 💍⏳🕊️✝️
## 1 Corinthians 7:40
Paul thinks she may be happier if she stays single. Paul thinks he has God's Holy Spirit to guide him. 🙂👤💭🕊️


## 1 Corinthians 8:1
Paul said: About food from fake gods. You say, “We all know.” 🧠 But knowing can make us proud 😕. God’s love helps people and makes us kind 😊.
## 1 Corinthians 8:2
If you think you know it all, you do not know it all yet. 🧠❌
## 1 Corinthians 8:3
If you love God, God knows you. ❤️🙏
## 1 Corinthians 8:4
About eating that food: fake gods are nothing 🗿❌. There is one God. Only one. 1️⃣
## 1 Corinthians 8:5
Some people say there are many gods in the sky or on the earth 🌌🌍. People call many things “gods” and “bosses.”
## 1 Corinthians 8:6
But for us, there is one God, the Father. All things come from Him, and we live for Him. And there is one Jesus. All things came by Him, and we live by Him. ✝️💖
## 1 Corinthians 8:7
Not all people know this. Some ate food for fake gods before. When they eat now, they still think it is for fake gods. Their hearts feel weak and bad. 🍽️😟
## 1 Corinthians 8:8
Food does not make us near God. If we eat or do not eat, we are the same to God. 🍞🤝
## 1 Corinthians 8:9
But be careful. What you do can make a weak friend trip. 🚫👣
## 1 Corinthians 8:10
If a weak friend sees you, the one who knows, eat in a fake god house, they may think it is okay. They may copy you, even when their heart says no. 🏛️🗿👀
## 1 Corinthians 8:11
Then your weak friend—the one Jesus died for—can get hurt by what you do. ❤️✝️
## 1 Corinthians 8:12
When you hurt weak friends like this, you do wrong to them, and you do wrong to Jesus. 😢✝️
## 1 Corinthians 8:13
So if my food makes my friend fall, I will not eat meat again. 🍖❌ I do not want to make my friend fall.


## 1 Corinthians 9:1
Paul said: I am free. I help Jesus. I saw Jesus. You are my work with Jesus. ✝️👀🧑‍🤝‍🧑
## 1 Corinthians 9:2
If some say I am not a helper, you know I am. You show my work is real in Jesus. 👍✝️
## 1 Corinthians 9:3
This is what I say to people who ask hard things about me. 🗣️
## 1 Corinthians 9:4
We can eat and drink when we work for you. 🍞🥤
## 1 Corinthians 9:5
We can have a wife who loves Jesus, like other Jesus helpers, like Jesus’ brothers, and Peter. 💍👫
## 1 Corinthians 9:6
Is it just Barnabas and me who must work to make money? 🧰💼
## 1 Corinthians 9:7
A soldier gets pay. A farmer eats fruit from his plants. A person with sheep drinks milk. 🪖🍇🐑🥛
## 1 Corinthians 9:8
This is not just my idea. God’s book says this too. 📖
## 1 Corinthians 9:9
God says, do not cover a cow’s mouth when it works. Let it eat. 🐄🌾
## 1 Corinthians 9:10
This is for us too. People who plant and cut food hope for good pay. 🌱🍎😊
## 1 Corinthians 9:11
We gave you Jesus things for your heart. Is it bad if we get food and help from you? 🍎🤝
## 1 Corinthians 9:12
Others get help from you. We could too. But we did not take it. We did not want to stop the good news. 🚫💰📣
## 1 Corinthians 9:13
People who work in God’s house get food from there. 🏠🍞
## 1 Corinthians 9:14
Jesus wants people who tell His good news to get help to live. ✝️🍽️
## 1 Corinthians 9:15
But I did not use this help. I do not want anyone to stop my joy in telling you. 😊📣
## 1 Corinthians 9:16
I must tell the good news. I have to do it. If I do not, it is bad for me. 🔥📣
## 1 Corinthians 9:17
If I want to do it, I get a gift. If I must do it, it is still my job from God. 🎁🛠️
## 1 Corinthians 9:18
My gift is this: I tell the good news for free. I do not use my right to get pay. 🆓📣
## 1 Corinthians 9:19
I am free. I choose to serve all people, to help many come to Jesus. 🤝➡️✝️
## 1 Corinthians 9:20
With Jewish people, I act like them to help them know Jesus. With rule people, I act kind to their rules to help them. 🫂📜
## 1 Corinthians 9:21
With people with no rules, I am with them too, to help them. I still obey God and Jesus. 🌍❤️✝️
## 1 Corinthians 9:22
With weak ones, I am gentle. I try many ways to save some. I want all to know Jesus. 🤗🛟✝️
## 1 Corinthians 9:23
I do this for the good news, so I can share the gift with them. 🎁📣
## 1 Corinthians 9:24
Many run in a race. One gets a prize. You all run to win for Jesus. 🏃‍♂️🏅
## 1 Corinthians 9:25
Runners train hard. They want a small prize. We want a prize that lasts forever with Jesus. 🏋️‍♂️🏆✨
## 1 Corinthians 9:26
I run with a plan. I do not fight the air. I know where to go. 🏃‍♂️👐➡️
## 1 Corinthians 9:27
I tell my body no. I make it obey. I do not want to teach and then do bad. 🚫🍰💪


## 1 Corinthians 10:1
Paul says, Friends, remember long ago. A big cloud was with God’s people. They walked by the sea. ☁️🌊
## 1 Corinthians 10:2
They were with Moses. The cloud and sea were like a bath to show this. ☁️🌊🛁
## 1 Corinthians 10:3
God gave them the same special food. 🍞
## 1 Corinthians 10:4
God gave them the same special drink. Water came from a rock. The Rock was Jesus. 💧🪨✝️
## 1 Corinthians 10:5
But God was not happy with many of them. They fell in the big dry land. 😔🏜️
## 1 Corinthians 10:6
These are lessons for us. Do not want to do bad. 📘✋
## 1 Corinthians 10:7
Do not bow to fake gods. Do not make a bad party like they did. 🚫🗿🎉
## 1 Corinthians 10:8
Do not do wrong with your body. Many, many died that day. 🚫🙅‍♂️
## 1 Corinthians 10:9
Do not test the Lord Jesus. Some did. Snakes bit them. ✝️🚫🐍
## 1 Corinthians 10:10
Do not cry and fuss at God. Some did, and they were hurt. 😢🚫
## 1 Corinthians 10:11
These things were written to help us learn. We live now. Learn from them. 📝👀
## 1 Corinthians 10:12
If you think you are strong, be careful. You may fall. ⚠️
## 1 Corinthians 10:13
Hard tests come to all. God is good. He will help you say no. He will make a way out. 💪🚪
## 1 Corinthians 10:14
My dear friends, run from fake gods. 🏃‍♀️🗿🚫
## 1 Corinthians 10:15
You are smart. Think about this. 🤔
## 1 Corinthians 10:16
We share the cup to thank Jesus. We share the bread. We think of Jesus’ blood and body. 🥖🍷✝️
## 1 Corinthians 10:17
We share one bread. So we are one group. 🤝🥖
## 1 Corinthians 10:18
Look at God’s people long ago. They ate gifts to God on the big God table. They shared. 🍖🕯️
## 1 Corinthians 10:19
Do I mean fake gods are real? No. ❌🗿
## 1 Corinthians 10:20
Some give food to bad spirits, not to God. Do not join bad spirits. 👿🚫
## 1 Corinthians 10:21
You cannot share with Jesus and bad spirits too. ✝️🚫👿
## 1 Corinthians 10:22
Do not make the Lord mad or sad. We are not stronger than Him. 😠➡️🙏
## 1 Corinthians 10:23
You may say, “I can do it.” But it may not help. It may not build up. 🧱⬆️
## 1 Corinthians 10:24
Do not just think of self. Help others. ❤️🙌
## 1 Corinthians 10:25
Eat food from the store. Do not worry or ask a lot. 🛒🍗
## 1 Corinthians 10:26
The world is the Lord’s. It is His. 🌍✝️
## 1 Corinthians 10:27
If a person who does not know God asks you to eat, you can go. Eat what is there. Do not ask a lot. 🍽️🙂
## 1 Corinthians 10:28
But if someone says, “This food was for a fake god,” then do not eat. Do it to help that person. ✋🗿🚫
## 1 Corinthians 10:29
Your heart is free with God. But care for their heart too. 💗🤝
## 1 Corinthians 10:30
If I thank God for food, why blame me? But still, I care for others. 🙏🍽️
## 1 Corinthians 10:31
So eat, drink, live. Do all for God. 🥤🍽️✨
## 1 Corinthians 10:32
Do not make any group mad: Jew, Greek, or God’s church. 🤝
## 1 Corinthians 10:33
I try to help all. I do not seek self. I want many to be saved by Jesus. 🙂✝️


## 1 Corinthians 11:1
Paul said, copy me, like I copy Christ. 👣✝️
## 1 Corinthians 11:2
Paul said, good job, you remember me and keep the rules I gave you. 👍📝
## 1 Corinthians 11:3
Paul said, know this: Christ is the head of every man, the man is the head of the woman, and God is the head of Christ. ⛪➡️👨➡️👩➡️God
## 1 Corinthians 11:4
If a man prays or talks for God with a cover on his head, it is not good for him. 🙆‍♂️🎩🚫
## 1 Corinthians 11:5
If a woman prays or talks for God with no cover, it is not good, like her hair is cut off. 🙆‍♀️🚫🧕✂️
## 1 Corinthians 11:6
If a woman will not cover, then she should cut her hair; if that is bad for her, she should cover her head. 🙆‍♀️🧕 or ✂️
## 1 Corinthians 11:7
A man should not cover his head; he shows God’s shine. A woman shows the man’s shine. 👨✨👩✨
## 1 Corinthians 11:8
The first woman came from the man, not the man from the woman. 👨➡️👩
## 1 Corinthians 11:9
The woman was made for the man, not the man for the woman. 👫
## 1 Corinthians 11:10
So a woman should show this with a cover on her head, because of angels. 🧕👼
## 1 Corinthians 11:11
But with the Lord, the woman needs the man, and the man needs the woman. 🤝❤️
## 1 Corinthians 11:12
The first woman came from the man, and now men are born from women; all are from God. 👶➡️👩‍🍼🙏
## 1 Corinthians 11:13
You think about it: Is it good for a woman to pray to God with no cover? 🤔🙆‍♀️🙏
## 1 Corinthians 11:14
You know this: long hair on a man is not good. 👨‍🦱➡️🚫
## 1 Corinthians 11:15
But long hair on a woman is nice. Her hair is like a cover. 👩‍🦰💖
## 1 Corinthians 11:16
If someone wants to fight about this, we will not fight. All God’s churches do it this way. ✋🕊️⛪⛪
## 1 Corinthians 11:17
Now I cannot say good job. Your church time hurts, not helps. ⛪😞
## 1 Corinthians 11:18
When you meet as a church, I hear you split into groups, and I think it is true. ⛪➡️👥👥
## 1 Corinthians 11:19
Some groups may show who does right. ✅❌
## 1 Corinthians 11:20
When you meet, you are not eating the Lord’s meal the right way. 🍞🍷🚫
## 1 Corinthians 11:21
Each one eats first. Some are hungry, and some drink too much. 🍽️😢🍷😵
## 1 Corinthians 11:22
You have homes to eat and drink. Do not shame God’s church or the poor. I will not praise you. 🏠➡️🍽️⛪❤️
## 1 Corinthians 11:23
I got this from the Lord and told you: the Lord Jesus, on the night He was taken, took bread. ✝️🍞
## 1 Corinthians 11:24
He gave thanks, broke it, and He said, <jesus>Take and eat. This is My body for you. Remember Me.</jesus> 🍞🙏
## 1 Corinthians 11:25
After the meal He took the cup and He said, <jesus>This cup is the new way with My blood. When you drink this, remember Me.</jesus> 🍷
## 1 Corinthians 11:26
When you eat this bread and drink this cup, you say Jesus died for us, until He comes. 🍞🍷✝️⏳
## 1 Corinthians 11:27
If you eat and drink in a bad way, you act wrong about Jesus’ body and blood. 🚫🍞🍷
## 1 Corinthians 11:28
Each one should stop and think first. Then eat the bread and drink the cup. ⏸️🤔🍞🍷
## 1 Corinthians 11:29
If you do not see what it means, you get in trouble when you eat and drink. 😕➡️⚠️
## 1 Corinthians 11:30
That is why some of you are weak and sick, and some died. 🤒💔
## 1 Corinthians 11:31
If we check our hearts, the Lord will not need to judge us. 💓🔍
## 1 Corinthians 11:32
When the Lord corrects us, He keeps us safe from the big wrong in the world. ✝️🛡️🌍
## 1 Corinthians 11:33
So, dear ones, when you eat, wait for each other. ⏳👫🍽️
## 1 Corinthians 11:34
If you are very hungry, eat at home first. Then church will be safe, not for trouble. I will tell more when I come. 🏠🍲➡️⛪🙂


## 1 Corinthians 12:1
Paul said, “Friends, I want to teach you about gifts from God's Holy Spirit.” 🎁🕊️
## 1 Corinthians 12:2
Paul said, “Before, you did not know God. You went to fake gods that could not talk.” 🚫🗿
## 1 Corinthians 12:3
Paul said, “God's Holy Spirit helps us talk right. No one with God's Holy Spirit says bad of Jesus. Only with God's Holy Spirit can a person say, ‘Jesus is my boss.’” 🕊️🗣️✝️
## 1 Corinthians 12:4
There are many gifts. But God's Holy Spirit is the same One who gives them. 🎁🕊️
## 1 Corinthians 12:5
There are many ways to serve. But Jesus is the same Lord we serve. 🙌✝️
## 1 Corinthians 12:6
There are many works to do. But the same God gives power to all. 💪✨
## 1 Corinthians 12:7
God's Holy Spirit gives each one a gift to help all of us. 🕊️🤝
## 1 Corinthians 12:8
One gets wise help (wisdom). Another gets to know things (knowledge). God's Holy Spirit gives both. 🧠🕊️
## 1 Corinthians 12:9
Another gets big trust in God (faith). Another gets power to heal sick people. 🫶🤒➡️😊
## 1 Corinthians 12:10
Another does big God acts (miracles). Another says God words. Another can tell good or bad spirit. Another talks in new words. Another can explain the new words. ✨🗣️🔍🗨️➡️💬
## 1 Corinthians 12:11
One and the same God's Holy Spirit does all this. He gives to each one as He wants. 🕊️🎁
## 1 Corinthians 12:12
Our body is one body, but it has many parts. It is like that with Jesus’ people too. 🧍‍♂️🧩
## 1 Corinthians 12:13
God's Holy Spirit made all of us one body. He made us drink of Him, the same Spirit. We are one. 🕊️💧1️⃣
## 1 Corinthians 12:14
One body is not just one part. It has many parts. 🧩➕🧩
## 1 Corinthians 12:15
If the foot says, “I am not a hand, so I am not part,” that is not true. The foot is still part. 🦶✋
## 1 Corinthians 12:16
If the ear says, “I am not an eye, so I am not part,” that is not true. The ear is still part. 👂👁️
## 1 Corinthians 12:17
If all was an eye, we could not hear. If all was an ear, we could not smell. 👁️❓👂👃
## 1 Corinthians 12:18
God put each part in the body just right. God chose it. ✋🦶👂👁️➡️🧍‍♀️
## 1 Corinthians 12:19
If all were one part, then it would not be a body. ❌🧩
## 1 Corinthians 12:20
Now there are many parts, but one body. ✅🧍‍♂️
## 1 Corinthians 12:21
The eye cannot say to the hand, “I do not need you.” The head cannot say to the feet, “I do not need you.” 👁️➡️✋❌ | 🧠➡️🦶❌
## 1 Corinthians 12:22
The parts that seem weak are very needed. 💪🧩
## 1 Corinthians 12:23
The parts we think are not nice to show, we cover and care for more. 🫶🧣
## 1 Corinthians 12:24
The parts that look fine do not need that. God made the body and gave more care to the parts that lacked. 🧍‍♀️❤️
## 1 Corinthians 12:25
God did this so the body will not split. All the parts care for each other. 🤝🧩
## 1 Corinthians 12:26
If one part hurts, all hurt. If one part is praised, all cheer. 😢➡️😢 | 🎉➡️🎉
## 1 Corinthians 12:27
You are Jesus’ body here. Each one of you is a part. ✝️🧍‍♀️🧍‍♂️🧍
## 1 Corinthians 12:28
God put helpers in God’s family: first some who go out to tell good news, then some who say God words, then teachers, then miracle workers, then people who heal, then helpers, then leaders who guide, then people who talk in new words. 🗺️🗣️👩‍🏫✨🩹🤝🧭💬
## 1 Corinthians 12:29
Is everyone a go-out helper? Is everyone a say-God-words helper? Is everyone a teacher? Is everyone a miracle worker? ❓❓❓
## 1 Corinthians 12:30
Does everyone heal? Does everyone talk in new words? Does everyone explain the new words? ❓❓❓
## 1 Corinthians 12:31
Want the best gifts. And I will show you the best way. It is God’s love. 🎁➡️❤️


## 1 Corinthians 13:1
Paul said, If I can talk with many people words or even angel words, but I do not love, I am just loud like a noisy bell. 🗣️🔔❌❤️
## 1 Corinthians 13:2
Paul said, If I can tell what will come, know a lot, and trust God so big I could move a hill, but I do not love, I am nothing. ⛰️➡️🛑❤️
## 1 Corinthians 13:3
Paul said, If I give all my things to help the poor and even let my body get hurt, but I do not love, I get nothing. 🎁🍞❌❤️
## 1 Corinthians 13:4
Paul said, Love waits. Love is kind. Love does not want what others have. Love does not brag. Love is not proud. ⏳😊🚫😠🚫🎺🚫👑
## 1 Corinthians 13:5
Paul said, Love is not rude. Love does not say, “Me first.” Love is not mad fast. Love does not keep a list of bad things. 🚫🙅‍♂️🍽️😤📝❌
## 1 Corinthians 13:6
Paul said, Love is not glad when people do bad. Love is glad when people tell the truth. 🚫😈✅🙂🗣️✔️
## 1 Corinthians 13:7
Paul said, Love never gives up. Love trusts. Love hopes. Love stays strong. 💪❤️🌟🔒
## 1 Corinthians 13:8
Paul said, Love never stops. But words that tell what will come will stop. Special talk will stop. Big knowing will stop. ❤️♾️⛔🗣️⛔🧠⛔
## 1 Corinthians 13:9
Paul said, Now we know only a little, and we tell only a little of what will come. 🧩📘
## 1 Corinthians 13:10
Paul said, But when all is made right, the little bits will end. ✅➡️🧩⛔
## 1 Corinthians 13:11
Paul said, When I was a child, I talked like a child, I felt like a child, I thought like a child. When I grew up, I put away child stuff. 🧒🗣️💭🙂➡️🧑📦
## 1 Corinthians 13:12
Paul said, Now we see like in a fuzzy mirror, but later we will see face to face. Now I know a little, but later I will know much. God knows me now. 🪞🌫️➡️🙂👀🙂
## 1 Corinthians 13:13
Paul said, So these three stay: trust in God, hope, and love. The best is love. ✝️🤝🌈❤️


## 1 Corinthians 14:1
Paul says: Love first. Ask God for gifts. Want most to speak God’s words that help people. ❤️🗣️
## 1 Corinthians 14:2
If you use other talk no one knows, you talk to God, not people; no one gets it; you say secret things with God. 🗣️🔐🙏
## 1 Corinthians 14:3
If you speak God’s words, you help people be strong, you help them, you make sad hearts feel better. 🗣️💪🙂
## 1 Corinthians 14:4
Other talk helps only you; God’s words help the whole church be strong. 🧍➡️⛪💪
## 1 Corinthians 14:5
I wish you all could use other talk, but I want more that you speak God’s words; if other talk is explained, then it helps like that too. 🗣️📝🙂
## 1 Corinthians 14:6
Family, if I come and only use other talk, I do not help you; I must bring a new word from God, or learning, or teaching you can use. 🚶‍♂️🗣️➡️📖🧠
## 1 Corinthians 14:7
Think of a flute or a harp; if notes are not clear, who knows the song? 🎶🎼❓
## 1 Corinthians 14:8
If a trumpet sound is not clear, who will get ready to fight? 🎺⚔️❓
## 1 Corinthians 14:9
So you too: if your words are not clear, who can know what you say? You are just talking to the air. 💬🌬️
## 1 Corinthians 14:10
There are many kinds of talk in the world, and each talk has a meaning. 🌍🗣️🔤
## 1 Corinthians 14:11
If I do not know the meaning, we are like strangers to each other. 🧍‍♂️↔️🧍‍♀️
## 1 Corinthians 14:12
You all want gifts from God; try most of all to help the church be strong. 🎁⛪💪
## 1 Corinthians 14:13
So, the one who uses other talk should pray to also explain it. 🙏🗣️📝
## 1 Corinthians 14:14
If I pray in other talk, my heart prays, but my mind does not learn. 🙏❤️🤷‍♂️
## 1 Corinthians 14:15
So I will pray with my heart and my mind; I will sing with my heart and my mind. 🙏🎵❤️🧠
## 1 Corinthians 14:16
If you thank God with words no one knows, new people cannot say “Amen,” because they do not know what you said. 🙏❓🙋‍♂️
## 1 Corinthians 14:17
You thank God well, but the other person is not helped. 🙏👍➡️🚫👥
## 1 Corinthians 14:18
I thank God I use other talk more than all of you. 🙌🗣️
## 1 Corinthians 14:19
But in church, I want five clear words to teach others, not many words no one knows. ⛪5️⃣🗣️✅
## 1 Corinthians 14:20
Family, do not think like little kids; be like babies about bad things, but think like grown-ups. 👶🚫😈🧠🧑
## 1 Corinthians 14:21
God’s rules say: “I will use other talk and other lips to speak to this people, but they still will not listen,” says God. 📖🗣️👂❌
## 1 Corinthians 14:22
So, other talk is a sign for people who do not believe; God’s words are for people who do believe. 🪧🗣️✅
## 1 Corinthians 14:23
If all of you use other talk and new people or people who do not believe come in, they will say you are not okay. ⛪🗣️🗣️🗣️😵
## 1 Corinthians 14:24
But if all of you speak God’s words, and a new person comes, he will feel sorry for wrong and will think about his life. 🗣️🫢🤔
## 1 Corinthians 14:25
His secret heart things will show; he will bow down and worship God and say, “God is here with you!” 🙇‍♂️🙏✨
## 1 Corinthians 14:26
So, family, when you meet, some have a song, some a lesson, some a new word, some other talk, some an explain; do all to help the church be strong. 🎵📖🗣️📝⛪💪
## 1 Corinthians 14:27
If people use other talk, only two or three, and take turns, and someone must explain. 2️⃣3️⃣🔁📝
## 1 Corinthians 14:28
If no one can explain, be quiet in church; talk to yourself and to God. 🤫⛪🙏
## 1 Corinthians 14:29
Two or three who speak God’s words may talk, and the others should think and check the words. ✌️➕☝️🧠✅
## 1 Corinthians 14:30
If a new word comes to someone sitting, the first one should stop and wait. ✋🪑➡️🗣️
## 1 Corinthians 14:31
You can all speak God’s words one by one, so all can learn and all can feel brave. 1️⃣by1️⃣📖🙂
## 1 Corinthians 14:32
The speaker can control himself; he can stop and wait. 🗣️⏸️🧠
## 1 Corinthians 14:33
God makes peace, not mix-up; this is for all the churches of God’s people. 🕊️✅
## 1 Corinthians 14:34
Women should be quiet in the church; they should listen and learn, like God’s rules say. 👩🤫⛪📖
## 1 Corinthians 14:35
If a woman wants to learn, she should ask her own man at home; it is not good for a woman to speak in church. 👩❓🏠👂
## 1 Corinthians 14:36
Did God’s word start with you? Are you the only ones who got it? ❓📖
## 1 Corinthians 14:37
If someone thinks he speaks God’s words or is very close to God, he must know I write God’s rule. 📝📖✅
## 1 Corinthians 14:38
If someone will not listen, then people will not listen to him. 🙉➡️🙅‍♂️
## 1 Corinthians 14:39
So, family, want to speak God’s words, and do not stop people who use other talk. 🗣️👍
## 1 Corinthians 14:40
Do all things in a good and calm way and in order. ✅🕊️


## 1 Corinthians 15:1
Paul said, I tell you all the good news again. You all got it. You all stand in it. ✝️📖🧍‍♀️🧍‍♂️
## 1 Corinthians 15:2
This good news helps you all be safe with God, if you all keep it. Do not stop. Do not make your trust empty. 🛟🙏
## 1 Corinthians 15:3
I told you first: Jesus died for our bad things, like God’s book said. ✝️📖
## 1 Corinthians 15:4
He was put in a tomb. On day 3 God made Him live again, like God’s book said. 🪦3️⃣🌅
## 1 Corinthians 15:5
He was seen by Peter. Then His twelve friends saw Him. 👀🧔👥
## 1 Corinthians 15:6
Then 500 people saw Him at one time. Most are alive now. Some have died. 👀👥👥👥
## 1 Corinthians 15:7
Then James saw Him. Then all His special helpers saw Him. 🧔👀👥
## 1 Corinthians 15:8
Last, I, Paul, saw Him too. I was very late. ✍️👀
## 1 Corinthians 15:9
I am the least helper. I hurt God’s church before. 😔⛪
## 1 Corinthians 15:10
But God was kind to me. I am me by God. I worked hard, but God worked in me. 💖💪
## 1 Corinthians 15:11
So if it is me or them, we say the same. You all said yes and trust. 🗣️✅
## 1 Corinthians 15:12
We say Jesus lived again. Why do some say dead people do not live again? ❓🌅
## 1 Corinthians 15:13
If dead people do not live again, then Jesus did not live again. 🚫🌅
## 1 Corinthians 15:14
If Jesus did not live again, our talk is empty, and your trust is empty. 🗣️❌
## 1 Corinthians 15:15
Then we would be liars about God, for we said God made Jesus live again. That would not be true if dead people do not live again. ❌🗣️
## 1 Corinthians 15:16
If the dead do not live again, then Jesus did not live again. 🔁🚫🌅
## 1 Corinthians 15:17
If Jesus did not live again, your trust is empty. You still have your bad things. 😟
## 1 Corinthians 15:18
Then people who died with Jesus would be lost. 💔💀
## 1 Corinthians 15:19
If our hope in Jesus is only for now, we are very sad people. 😢
## 1 Corinthians 15:20
But Jesus did live again! He is first, and many who died will live again too. 🌅🏆😊
## 1 Corinthians 15:21
A man, Adam, brought death. A man, Jesus, brings life again. 🧑➡️💀 | Jesus ➡️🌅
## 1 Corinthians 15:22
All in Adam die. All in Jesus will live. 💀➡️🌅
## 1 Corinthians 15:23
There is a plan. Jesus is first. Later, His people will live when He comes. ⏱️👑🌅
## 1 Corinthians 15:24
Then the end comes. Jesus gives the kingdom to God the Father. He stops all bad rule and power. 👑➡️🪘🙌
## 1 Corinthians 15:25
Jesus must be King. He wins over all His enemies. 👑⚔️✅
## 1 Corinthians 15:26
The last enemy is death. It will be gone. 💀🚫
## 1 Corinthians 15:27
God put all things under Jesus. But God is not under Jesus. God is over all. ⬇️👑 | God 👆
## 1 Corinthians 15:28
When all is under Jesus, the Son will give it all to God. God will be over all. 👑➡️🙏
## 1 Corinthians 15:29
If dead people do not live, why do some people get wet for dead people? 💧💀❓
## 1 Corinthians 15:30
And why do we face danger all the time? ⚠️⏰
## 1 Corinthians 15:31
I face death each day for our Lord Jesus. ✝️🗓️
## 1 Corinthians 15:32
I fought hard in Ephesus. If the dead do not live, why do that? Then we would just eat and drink, for we die soon. 🥊🏙️🍞🥤
## 1 Corinthians 15:33
Do not be tricked. Bad friends make you act bad. 🚫🧠👎
## 1 Corinthians 15:34
Wake up. Do not do bad. Some do not know God. This is not good. ⏰🚫
## 1 Corinthians 15:35
Some ask, How do the dead live? What body do they get? ❓🧍‍♂️🌅
## 1 Corinthians 15:36
Think. A seed goes in dirt and looks dead. Then it grows. 🌱🪴➡️🌿
## 1 Corinthians 15:37
You plant a seed, not the big plant. You plant a small seed. 🌾➡️🌳
## 1 Corinthians 15:38
God gives each seed a new body, the one He wants. 🌱➡️🌷
## 1 Corinthians 15:39
Not all bodies are the same. People, animals, birds, and fish are all different. 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦🐶🐦🐟
## 1 Corinthians 15:40
There are bodies in the sky and bodies on earth. Each is different. ☀️🌙⭐🌍
## 1 Corinthians 15:41
The sun shines one way. The moon shines another way. Stars shine too, and each star is not the same. ☀️✨🌙⭐
## 1 Corinthians 15:42
It is like this with people who die and live again. The body goes in the ground weak. God raises it new and strong. ⚰️➡️💪
## 1 Corinthians 15:43
It goes down sad and weak. It comes up bright and strong. 😢➡️😊💪
## 1 Corinthians 15:44
It goes down a body like now. It comes up a new body from God. 🧍‍♂️➡️🧍‍♂️✨
## 1 Corinthians 15:45
The first man, Adam, became alive. The last Adam, Jesus, makes people live. 🧑➡️💓 | Jesus ➡️🌅
## 1 Corinthians 15:46
First comes the body like now. After comes the new body from God. ⏩🧍‍♂️➡️🧍‍♂️✨
## 1 Corinthians 15:47
The first man came from dirt. The second man, Jesus our Lord, came from heaven. 🧑🪴 | Jesus 👑⬇️☁️
## 1 Corinthians 15:48
People like Adam are like him. People like Jesus are like Him. 🧍‍♂️➡️🧍‍♂️ | 🧍‍♂️✨➡️🧍‍♂️✨
## 1 Corinthians 15:49
We now look like the first man. One day we will look like Jesus from heaven. 👤➡️👤✨
## 1 Corinthians 15:50
Our bodies now cannot live in God’s kingdom. Weak, bad stuff cannot last forever. 🚫🏰♾️
## 1 Corinthians 15:51
Listen! I tell you a secret. Not all will die. But all will change. 🤫🔔
## 1 Corinthians 15:52
It will be fast, like a blink. A last horn will blow. The dead will live, and we will change. 👁️✨📯🌅
## 1 Corinthians 15:53
This weak body must put on a forever body. 💪➡️♾️
## 1 Corinthians 15:54
When we have the forever body, death is beat. Death is gone. ♾️💀🚫
## 1 Corinthians 15:55
Paul said to death, Hey death, where is your hurt? Hey grave, where did you win? 💀🐝❓🪦❓
## 1 Corinthians 15:56
Death hurts because of bad things. Rules show our bad. 😣📜
## 1 Corinthians 15:57
But thank You, God! God gives us the win by our Lord Jesus Christ. 🙏🏆✝️
## 1 Corinthians 15:58
So, dear friends, stand strong. Do God’s work a lot. Your work for the Lord is not a waste. 🧍‍♂️🧍‍♀️💪❤️


## 1 Corinthians 16:1
Paul talks about the money to help God’s people. Do it like the churches in Galatia. 💰🤝
## 1 Corinthians 16:2
On the first day each week, each one should save some money, as you can, so no big ask when I come. 🗓️💵
## 1 Corinthians 16:3
When I come, I will send the helpers you pick with a note to take your gift to Jerusalem. ✉️🧑‍🤝‍🧑🏙️
## 1 Corinthians 16:4
If I should go too, I will go with them. 🧳🚶‍♂️
## 1 Corinthians 16:5
I will visit you after I go by Macedonia. 🗺️➡️
## 1 Corinthians 16:6
I may stay with you, maybe for winter, then you can help me travel on. ❄️🏠
## 1 Corinthians 16:7
I do not want a quick stop now. I hope to stay a while, if the Lord lets me. ⏳🙏
## 1 Corinthians 16:8
But I will stay in Ephesus until Pentecost. 📍⏰
## 1 Corinthians 16:9
A big door is open here for good work, but many people do not like it. 🚪✨😐
## 1 Corinthians 16:10
If Timothy comes, make him feel safe. He works for the Lord like I do. 🧒✝️
## 1 Corinthians 16:11
Do not be mean to him. Send him back to me with peace. I wait for him with the brothers. 🕊️😊
## 1 Corinthians 16:12
About Apollos: I asked him to go with the brothers. He did not want to now. He will go later when he can. ⏱️🚶‍♂️
## 1 Corinthians 16:13
Stay awake. Stand strong in your trust in Jesus. Be brave. Be strong. 💪👀
## 1 Corinthians 16:14
Do all you do with love. ❤️
## 1 Corinthians 16:15
You know Stephanas and his house; they were first to believe in Achaia, and they help God’s people a lot. 🏠🤲
## 1 Corinthians 16:16
Follow people like them. Work with and respect all who help. 🙌
## 1 Corinthians 16:17
I am glad that Stephanas, Fortunatus, and Achaicus came. They helped me for you. 😀🤝
## 1 Corinthians 16:18
They made me feel better, and they help you too. Please say thank you to people like them. 😊🙏
## 1 Corinthians 16:19
The churches in Asia say hello. Aquila and Prisca and the church in their house say a big hello in the Lord. 🏠👋
## 1 Corinthians 16:20
All the brothers and sisters say hello. Say hello to each other with a holy kiss. 🤗💋
## 1 Corinthians 16:21
I, Paul, write this hello with my own hand. ✍️
## 1 Corinthians 16:22
If someone does not love the Lord Jesus, that is very bad. Lord Jesus, please come. 🙏
## 1 Corinthians 16:23
May the Lord Jesus be kind to you. ✝️
## 1 Corinthians 16:24
I love all of you in Christ Jesus. ❤️


## 2 Corinthians 1:1
Paul writes this. God sent Paul. Timothy helps him. To God’s church in the city Corinth, and to all God’s people in Achaia. 📝👋⛪️
## 2 Corinthians 1:2
May God our Father and the Lord Jesus give you kind help and peace. 🙏🕊️
## 2 Corinthians 1:3
We say, “Thank You, God,” the Father of our Lord Jesus. God is very kind. God helps us when we are sad. 🙌❤️
## 2 Corinthians 1:4
God helps us in every hard time, so we can help other people when they have hard times too. 🤝💙
## 2 Corinthians 1:5
We have many hard things like Jesus had. But Jesus gives us much help too. ✝️💪

When we have hard times, it helps you learn to be strong. When God helps us, it helps you too. You can be strong like us. 🌧️➡️🌈
## 2 Corinthians 1:7
We are sure about you. You share hard times with us, and you will share help with us too. 🤗
## 2 Corinthians 1:8
Friends, we had a very hard time in a place called Asia. It was too hard for us. We felt like we would die. 😢😔
## 2 Corinthians 1:9
It felt like a death note. But this made us trust God, not us. God can make dead people live again. 🙏🌟
## 2 Corinthians 1:10
God saved us from that big danger. God will save us again. We hope in God. 🛟✨
## 2 Corinthians 1:11
You can help us by prayer. Then many people will say, “Thank You, God!” when God helps us. 🤲🗣️
## 2 Corinthians 1:12
We did what is right. We were honest. We did not use tricks. God helped us be good to you. ✅🤍
## 2 Corinthians 1:13
We write plain words. You can read and know them. 📖👀
## 2 Corinthians 1:14
One day, when Jesus comes, we will be glad for you, and you will be glad for us. 😀🎉
## 2 Corinthians 1:15
I planned to visit you first, so you could have more help and joy. 🗺️😊
## 2 Corinthians 1:16
I wanted to see you, then go to Macedonia, then come back to you, and then you could send me on to Judea. 🚶➡️🧭➡️↩️➡️✈️
## 2 Corinthians 1:17
Do you think I say yes and no at the same time? Do you think I change my plans all the time? 🤔❓
## 2 Corinthians 1:18
God is true. We did not say yes and no. We spoke clear words to you. 🗣️✅
## 2 Corinthians 1:19
We told you about God’s Son, Jesus Christ—Silvanus, Timothy, and I did. Jesus is not “yes and no.” In Him it is “Yes.” ✝️✅
## 2 Corinthians 1:20
All God’s promises are “Yes” in Him. We say, “Amen!” We say this to God to give thanks. 🙏✅🗣️
## 2 Corinthians 1:21
God makes us strong with you in Jesus Christ. God chose us to do His work. 💪🤝
## 2 Corinthians 1:22
God put His mark on us. God gave us God’s Holy Spirit in our hearts. This shows we are His. 💖🕊️
## 2 Corinthians 1:23
God knows this is true: I did not come again to Corinth because I did not want to make you sad. 🙅‍♂️😢
## 2 Corinthians 1:24
We are not boss over your trust in Jesus. We work with you, so you can have joy. You stand strong in trust. 🤝😊


## 2 Corinthians 2:1
Paul said, I will not come to make you all sad again. 📨😢
## 2 Corinthians 2:2
If I make you sad, who will make me glad? You are the ones who make me glad. 🙂💛
## 2 Corinthians 2:3
I wrote so I will not be sad when I come. I trust all of you will make me glad. 📜😊
## 2 Corinthians 2:4
I wrote with a hurt heart and many tears. I did not want to hurt you. I love you big. I love you with God's love. 😭❤️
## 2 Corinthians 2:5
If someone made you sad, he made all of you sad, not only me. 😔👥
## 2 Corinthians 2:6
Most of you gave him a time-out. That is enough now. ✋⏱️
## 2 Corinthians 2:7
Now forgive him and help him feel better, so he is not too sad. 🤝💞
## 2 Corinthians 2:8
I ask you, show your love to him again. Please love him. ❤️🙏
## 2 Corinthians 2:9
I wrote to see if you would obey. 👀✅
## 2 Corinthians 2:10
If you forgive anyone, I forgive too. I forgive for you, with Jesus watching. ✝️🤝
## 2 Corinthians 2:11
We do this so Satan, the bad one, will not trick us. 🛡️🐍
## 2 Corinthians 2:12
I came to Troas to tell the good news of Jesus. God opened a door for me. 🚪🗣️✝️
## 2 Corinthians 2:13
I was not at rest, because I did not find my friend Titus. So I said bye and went to Macedonia. 😟👋🧳
## 2 Corinthians 2:14
Thanks to God! In Jesus, God leads us like a happy parade. God uses us to spread good news like a good smell everywhere. 🎉🙏👃
## 2 Corinthians 2:15
We are like a good smell for God. We smell like Jesus to people who are saved and to people who are not. 👃✝️🌍
## 2 Corinthians 2:16
To some, we smell like death. To others, we smell like life. This job is very hard. Who can do it? 😶‍🌫️➡️💔 or 💖
## 2 Corinthians 2:17
We do not sell God's word. We are true. God sent us. God sees us. We speak for Jesus. 📖🚫💰✅✝️


## 2 Corinthians 3:1
Paul says, “Do we need a paper to say we are good workers for God? No.” 📝❌
## 2 Corinthians 3:2
Paul says, “You all are like our letter. We keep you in our hearts. People can see your life.” 💌❤️
## 2 Corinthians 3:3
Paul says, “You show you are a letter from Jesus. We helped. It was not ink. It was God's Holy Spirit. It was not on stone. It was on your hearts.” ✝️🕊️💖
## 2 Corinthians 3:4
Paul says, “We trust God because of Jesus.” 🙏✨
## 2 Corinthians 3:5
Paul says, “We are not able by our own self. God makes us able.” 🤲➡️🙏
## 2 Corinthians 3:6
Paul says, “God made us able to help in the new way. It is not just rules. God's Holy Spirit gives life.” 🌱🕊️
## 2 Corinthians 3:7
Paul says, “The old way had stone rules. It made Moses’ face shine. People could not look long. The shine went away.” 🪨✨🙈
## 2 Corinthians 3:8
Paul says, “The new way with God's Holy Spirit shines more.” 🕊️🌟
## 2 Corinthians 3:9
Paul says, “The old way said, ‘You did bad.’ The new way makes us right with God and shines more.” 👍🌟
## 2 Corinthians 3:10
Paul says, “The old shine looks small next to the big new shine.” 🔦➡️☀️
## 2 Corinthians 3:11
Paul says, “The old shine went away. The new shine stays.” ⏳❌➡️♾️✨
## 2 Corinthians 3:12
Paul says, “We have hope. So we talk brave.” 🗣️💪
## 2 Corinthians 3:13
Paul says, “We are not like Moses. He put a cover on his face so they would not see the shine go away.” 😶‍🌫️🧣
## 2 Corinthians 3:14
Paul says, “Their hearts were hard. When they read the old rules, a cover stays. Only Jesus takes the cover off.” 📖🧣➡️✝️
## 2 Corinthians 3:15
Paul says, “Even now, when they read Moses, a cover is on their hearts.” 📘🧣
## 2 Corinthians 3:16
Paul says, “When a person turns to the Lord, the cover comes off.” 🔄➡️👀
## 2 Corinthians 3:17
Paul says, “The Lord is God's Holy Spirit. Where God's Holy Spirit is, we are free.” 🕊️🔓😊
## 2 Corinthians 3:18
Paul says, “We all look at the Lord with no cover. We change to be like Him more and more. God's Holy Spirit does this.” 👀➡️✨🙂➡️🙂🙂🕊️


## 2 Corinthians 4:1
Paul and his friends have a job from God to tell good news. God was kind to them. So they do not quit. 💌💪🙏
## 2 Corinthians 4:2
They say no to bad, secret ways. They do not trick. They tell God’s true word. God sees them. People can see they are true. 👀🗣️✨
## 2 Corinthians 4:3
If the good news looks hidden, it is hidden to people who do not see. 🙈🗞️
## 2 Corinthians 4:4
The bad one in this world makes them not see. Their minds are dark. They do not see the bright good news about Jesus. Jesus shows us God. 😶‍🌫️🚫💡👑
## 2 Corinthians 4:5
Paul and friends do not talk big about themselves. They tell about the Lord Jesus. They are helpers for the people, for Jesus. 🙏🤝
## 2 Corinthians 4:6
Long ago God said, “Let light shine in the dark.” Now God puts light in their hearts. This light helps them know Jesus. When they see Jesus, they see God. 🌗➡️🌞❤️👀
## 2 Corinthians 4:7
They carry this good gift in weak bodies, like jars of mud. This shows God’s power is big. Their power is small. 🏺💡💪
## 2 Corinthians 4:8
They get pushed on all sides, but they are not broken. They get mixed up, but they do not give up. 🔄💥💗
## 2 Corinthians 4:9
People hurt them, but God does not leave them. They get hit down, but they get up again. 🚶‍♂️🙏⬆️
## 2 Corinthians 4:10
They suffer like Jesus. Then the life of Jesus can be seen in them. ✝️➡️💖
## 2 Corinthians 4:11
They face death each day for Jesus. Then Jesus’ life can be seen in their weak bodies. 📅⚠️➡️💖
## 2 Corinthians 4:12
So they get hurt, and the people get life. ❤️‍🩹➡️💚
## 2 Corinthians 4:13
The Bible says, “I believe, so I talk.” They also believe. So they talk. 📖🗣️
## 2 Corinthians 4:14
God made the Lord Jesus live again. God will make them live again with Jesus. God will bring them with the people to Him. ✝️🌅🤝
## 2 Corinthians 4:15
All this is for the people. God is kind to more and more people. Then more and more people say, “Thank You, God!” 🙌💝
## 2 Corinthians 4:16
So they do not quit. Their bodies get weak. But inside they get new each day. 🌄💪💗
## 2 Corinthians 4:17
Their hard time is small and short. God will give a big, forever good life. 🎁⏳➡️🌟
## 2 Corinthians 4:18
They do not look only at things they can see. They look to things they cannot see yet. What they see now will end. God’s things last forever. 👀🚫➡️✨♾️


## 2 Corinthians 5:1
Paul says: Our body is like a tent. If it breaks, God has a home for us in heaven. It is forever. God made it. ⛺️➡️🏠⬆️✨

## 2 Corinthians 5:3

## 2 Corinthians 5:6
Paul says: So we are brave. Now we live in our body. We are not with Jesus face to face yet. 💪🏽👤⏳
## 2 Corinthians 5:7
Paul says: We live by trust in God, not by what we see. 🚶‍♂️🙏👀❌
## 2 Corinthians 5:8
Paul says: We are brave. We would like to go and be at home with Jesus. 💪🏽🏠✝️
## 2 Corinthians 5:9
Paul says: So we try to make Him happy, here or there. 🎯😊🙏
## 2 Corinthians 5:10
Paul says: One day we will stand before Jesus. He will see what we did, good or bad. He will give what is right. 👑⚖️👣
## 2 Corinthians 5:11
Paul says: We respect the Lord. So we tell people. God knows us. We hope you know us too. 🙏📣💬
## 2 Corinthians 5:12
Paul says: We do not brag. We give you words so you can stand up for us, not for show but for the heart. 🙅‍♂️🏆❤️
## 2 Corinthians 5:13
Paul says: If we look wild, it is for God. If we look calm, it is for you. 🤪➡️🙏🙂➡️🫶
## 2 Corinthians 5:14
Paul says: God's love in Jesus leads us. Jesus died for all people. Jesus loves us. ❤️✝️🌍
## 2 Corinthians 5:15
Paul says: Jesus died for all. Now we live for Him. He died, and He rose. ✝️➡️🫶🙏✨
## 2 Corinthians 5:16
Paul says: Now we do not look at people by outside things. We do not think of Jesus in that old way. 👀❌🧍‍♂️💖
## 2 Corinthians 5:17
Paul says: When a person is with Jesus, the person is new. The old life is gone. A new life is here. 🌱🚪➡️✨
## 2 Corinthians 5:18
Paul says: God did this. God used Jesus to make peace with us. God gave us work to help people make peace with God. 🙌🤝✝️🫶
## 2 Corinthians 5:19
Paul says: In Jesus, God made peace with the world. God did not keep a list of our wrongs. God gave us good news to share. 🌍🤝📝❌📣
## 2 Corinthians 5:20
Paul says: So we speak for Jesus. God talks by us. We ask you, please make peace with God. 🗣️✝️🙏🤝
## 2 Corinthians 5:21
Paul says: God put our wrong on Jesus. Jesus did no wrong. In Jesus, God makes us right with Him. ✝️🔁✅❤️


## 2 Corinthians 6:1
We work with God. Please do not waste God’s gift. 🤝🎁
## 2 Corinthians 6:2
God says, “I hear you. I help you.” Now is the good time. Today God saves. ⏰🙏❤️
## 2 Corinthians 6:3
We try not to make people upset, so God’s work will not look bad. 🙂✋
## 2 Corinthians 6:4
We work for God. We keep going in hard times, in pain, in need, and in trouble. 💪😣
## 2 Corinthians 6:5
We were hit. We were in jail. Crowds were wild. We worked hard. We stayed up late. We were hungry. 🥊🚪👥⚒️🌙🍽️
## 2 Corinthians 6:6
We live clean. We know what is true. We wait a long time. We are kind. God’s Holy Spirit helps. We love for real. 🧼📖⏳😊🕊️❤️
## 2 Corinthians 6:7
We speak truth. God’s power helps us. God makes us strong to do right, on both sides. 🗣️✅⚡🛡️
## 2 Corinthians 6:8
People say nice things and mean things. Some call us liars, but we tell the truth. 👍👎🗣️✅
## 2 Corinthians 6:9
Some do not know us, but many do. It looks like we may die, but we live. We get hurt, but we are not killed. 👤👥⚰️➡️🫀
## 2 Corinthians 6:10
We are sad, but we still sing. We are poor, but we make many rich in God. We have nothing, but in God we have all we need. 😢🎵💸➡️💖👐🙏
## 2 Corinthians 6:11
Dear Corinth friends, we talk to you. Our heart is big for you. 🗣️💗
## 2 Corinthians 6:12
We do not make you small. Your own hearts feel tight. 🚫🤏💔
## 2 Corinthians 6:13
Please do the same. Open your hearts to us. 🌷💖
## 2 Corinthians 6:14
Do not team up with people who do not believe in Jesus. Right and wrong do not match. Light and dark do not mix. 🚫🤝❌⚖️🌞🌑
## 2 Corinthians 6:15
Jesus and the bad one do not agree. One who believes and one who does not believe do not match. ✝️❌😈✔️❌
## 2 Corinthians 6:16
God’s house and fake gods do not match. You are God’s house. God says, “I live with you. I walk with you. I will be your God. You are my people.” 🏠❌🗿➡️🏠👣💞
## 2 Corinthians 6:17
So, God says, “Come out from them. Be different. Do not touch bad things. I will take you in.” 🚶‍♂️➡️🚪✨✋🧼🤗

Paul said: We went to a land called Macedonia. We had no rest. People fought us outside. Inside we felt afraid. 🧳😴❌⚔️😟
## 2 Corinthians 7:6
Paul said: But God helps people who feel low. God made us feel better when our friend Titus came. 🙏🤗👣
## 2 Corinthians 7:7
Paul said: Titus told us you cared for us. You wanted to see us. You were sad, and you loved us. This made me even more glad. 😢❤️😊
## 2 Corinthians 7:8
Paul said: I sent you a letter. It made you sad for a short time. I felt a little bad. But now I do not feel bad. ✉️😢⏳🙂
## 2 Corinthians 7:9
Paul said: I am glad now. Not glad you were sad. I am glad your sad made you change and do good God’s way. We did not harm you. 😊➡️👍🙏
## 2 Corinthians 7:10
Paul said: Sad in God’s way helps you turn and live. You do not feel bad after. Sad in the world’s way hurts and ends bad. 😢🙏➡️💖 / 😢🌎➡️💔
## 2 Corinthians 7:11
Paul said: Look what your God way sad did! You tried to fix things. You cared a lot. You were upset at wrong. You had some fear. You wanted us. You were quick to do right. You made the wrong right. You showed you were clean in this. 🛠️❤️😠⚠️👀🏃‍♂️✅🧼
## 2 Corinthians 7:12
Paul said: When I wrote, it was not only about the one who did the bad or the one who was hurt. It was so you could see how much you care for us, and God could see it too. ✉️👀🙏
## 2 Corinthians 7:13
Paul said: We felt better. We were extra glad, because Titus was very happy. You all made his heart feel fresh again. 😊🤗💧💙
## 2 Corinthians 7:14
Paul said: I told Titus good things about you. I was right. What I said was true. 🗣️👍✅
## 2 Corinthians 7:15
Paul said: Titus loves you even more now. He thinks of how you did what was asked and welcomed him with care and gentle hearts. 🤗🏠💞
## 2 Corinthians 7:16
Paul said: I am so glad. I trust you in many things. 😀🤝


## 2 Corinthians 8:1
Paul said, I want you to know how God helped the churches in Macedonia. 🙏💙
## 2 Corinthians 8:2
Those people had big pain and were very poor, but they had big joy and gave a lot. 😔➡️😊🎁
## 2 Corinthians 8:3
They gave as much as they could, and more, by their own choice. 🙌🎁
## 2 Corinthians 8:4
They begged us to let them help God’s people who need help. 👐🙏
## 2 Corinthians 8:5
They gave themselves to the Lord first, and then to us, just like God wanted. ❤️🙇‍♂️
## 2 Corinthians 8:6
So we asked Titus to finish this gift with you, like he started. 📨🏁
## 2 Corinthians 8:7
You do well in faith, words, knowing, care, and love. Do well in giving too. ⭐🗣️📘❤️🎁
## 2 Corinthians 8:8
I am not making a rule. I want to see if your love is real, like their love. 🧡🤝
## 2 Corinthians 8:9
You know about our Lord Jesus Christ. He was rich, but He became poor for you, so you can have what you need. ✝️👑➡️🧥
## 2 Corinthians 8:10
Here is my kind think. This helps you. Last year you started to want to give and to do it. 📅📝🎁
## 2 Corinthians 8:11
Now finish it. Do it with what you have. ✅🏁🎁
## 2 Corinthians 8:12
If you want to give, God sees your heart. Give from what you have, not what you do not have. 💛👀🎁
## 2 Corinthians 8:13
We do not want others to rest while you hurt. We want fair. ⚖️
## 2 Corinthians 8:14
Now you have more. Help them. Later they may help you. Then it is fair. 🔄🤝
## 2 Corinthians 8:15
It says, the one who got much had no extra, and the one who got little had enough. 🍞🥣
## 2 Corinthians 8:16
Thank God. He put the same care for you in Titus. 🙏💚
## 2 Corinthians 8:17
Titus said yes. He cares a lot. He is coming to you by his own choice. 🧍‍♂️➡️🏙️
## 2 Corinthians 8:18
A brother will go with him. Many churches know him for the good news of Jesus. 👬📣✝️
## 2 Corinthians 8:19
The churches picked him to travel with us to carry the gift, to make the Lord glad and show our good heart. 🧳🎁🙌
## 2 Corinthians 8:20
We do this so no one can say we did wrong with the big gift. 🛡️🎁
## 2 Corinthians 8:21
We try to do what is good and right to the Lord and to people. ✅👀
## 2 Corinthians 8:22
We send another brother too. We tried him many times. He cares a lot. He feels sure about you. 👤👍💪
## 2 Corinthians 8:23
Titus is my helper and friend in work for you. The other men are church helpers. They make Jesus look good. 🤝⛪✝️
## 2 Corinthians 8:24
So show your love to them. Show all the churches that what I said about you is true. 💗👀✅


## 2 Corinthians 9:1
Paul says: I know all of you help God’s people. I do not need to say more. 🤝✉️
## 2 Corinthians 9:2
Paul says: I know you want to give. I told people in Macedonia that Achaia was ready last year. Your want to help made many want to help too. 🌟🎁➡️🎁
## 2 Corinthians 9:3
Paul says: I sent some brothers to you, so you will be ready, like I said. 🧑‍🤝‍🧑➡️🏠⏱️
## 2 Corinthians 9:4
If friends from Macedonia come with me and you are not ready, we will feel bad. 🙈😟
## 2 Corinthians 9:5
So I asked the brothers to go first. They will help get your gift ready. Give because you want to, not because you must. 🚶‍♂️🚶‍♂️➡️🎁❤️
## 2 Corinthians 9:6
If you plant a little, you get a little. If you plant a lot, you get a lot. 🌱➡️🌱 | 🌾➡️🌾
## 2 Corinthians 9:7
Each one should give what he decides. Do not be sad or forced. God loves a happy giver. 😊🎁❤️
## 2 Corinthians 9:8
God can give all you need, all the time, so you can do many good things. 🙌🧺✨
## 2 Corinthians 9:9
The book says: A good man gives to poor people. His good lasts a long time. 📖🤲🕰️
## 2 Corinthians 9:10
God gives seed to the farmer and bread to eat. God will give you more to give and grow your good works. 🌾🍞⬆️❤️
## 2 Corinthians 9:11
God will give you much, so you can give much. Then many people will thank God. 🎁➡️🎁🙏
## 2 Corinthians 9:12
Your gift helps God’s people. Your gift also makes many thank God. 🧺🤝🙏🙏

They will pray for you and want to see you, because they see God’s big gift in you. 🙏💌❤️
## 2 Corinthians 9:15
Thank You, God, for Your big gift! 🙏🎁✨


## 2 Corinthians 10:1
Paul talks to all of you. He asks with Jesus’ kind and gentle way. When he is with you, he is soft. When he is far, he writes strong words. 🤲✍️
## 2 Corinthians 10:2
Paul asks this: when he comes, he does not want to be tough. But he can be brave to some who say Paul lives in a wrong human way. 🙏💬
## 2 Corinthians 10:3
We live like people, but we do not fight like people fight. 🚶‍♂️🛑⚔️
## 2 Corinthians 10:4
Our fight tools are not of this world. God gives us power to break strong bad walls in minds. 🛠️💪✨🧠
## 2 Corinthians 10:5
We stop bad ideas and proud talk that stand against knowing God. We catch each thought and make it obey Jesus. 🧠✋➡️🙏
## 2 Corinthians 10:6
We are ready to stop all not obeying, when all of you obey all the way. ⏱️✅
## 2 Corinthians 10:7
Look with your eyes. If someone says, “I belong to Jesus,” that person should know this: we belong to Jesus too. 👀✝️
## 2 Corinthians 10:8
If Paul brags a little about his right to lead, the Lord Jesus gave it to build you up, not to break you down. Paul is not sorry for that. 🧱⬆️🙂
## 2 Corinthians 10:9
Paul does not want his letters to scare you. 📜😟➡️🕊️
## 2 Corinthians 10:10
Some people say, “His letters are big and strong, but when he is here, he looks weak, and he does not talk well.” 💬📜💪 / 🚶‍♂️😔🗣️
## 2 Corinthians 10:11
That person must know this: what Paul says in letters when far, he will do when he is there. ✍️=🚶‍♂️
## 2 Corinthians 10:12
We will not stand with people who praise self. They look only at self and say, “I am best.” That is not wise. 🚫🏅😕
## 2 Corinthians 10:13
We will not brag past our job. We will talk about the job God gave us. This job came even to you. 🗺️🛤️
## 2 Corinthians 10:14
We are not going too far. We came to you first with the good news of Jesus. ✝️📣➡️🫵
## 2 Corinthians 10:15
We do not brag about work other people did. We hope your trust will grow. Then we can do more work with you. 🌱➡️🌳
## 2 Corinthians 10:16
We want to share the good news in far places past you. We do not want to brag about work others did. 🧭✝️📣
## 2 Corinthians 10:17
If you brag, brag about the Lord. 🙌
## 2 Corinthians 10:18
The one who praises self is not the one who is okay. The Lord is the One who says yes to a person. ✅✝️

## 2 Corinthians 11:3
Paul says: I am afraid the snake tricked Eve, and you may get tricked too. I want you to stay simple and true with Jesus. 🐍😟✝️
## 2 Corinthians 11:4
Paul says: If someone talks about a different Jesus, a different spirit, or different good news, you let it happen too easy. 🚫✝️
## 2 Corinthians 11:5
Paul says: I am not less than those big teachers. 💬💪
## 2 Corinthians 11:6
Paul says: I may not talk fancy, but I know the truth. We showed you this. 🗣️✅
## 2 Corinthians 11:7
Paul says: Did I do wrong when I made me small so you could be lifted? I told you God’s good news for free. 🤲❤️
## 2 Corinthians 11:8
Paul says: Other churches helped me so I could serve you. 💒🤝
## 2 Corinthians 11:9
Paul says: When I was with you and needed help, I did not ask you. Friends from far away gave me what I needed. I will not be a load to you. 🎁🙂
## 2 Corinthians 11:10
Paul says: With Jesus’ truth in me, I will keep saying this in all that place. ✝️🗺️
## 2 Corinthians 11:11
Paul says: Why do I do this? Is it because I do not love you? God knows I love you. ❤️🙏
## 2 Corinthians 11:12
Paul says: I will keep doing this to stop men who want to look like us but are not. ✋🛑
## 2 Corinthians 11:13
Paul says: Those men are fake. They dress up like helpers of Jesus, but they are not. 🎭🚫
## 2 Corinthians 11:14

## 2 Corinthians 11:15
Paul says: His helpers can look good too. In the end, they will get what they earn. ⚖️
## 2 Corinthians 11:16
Paul says: I say it again: do not think I am silly. But if you do, let me talk a little like a silly man and brag a bit. 🙂🗣️
## 2 Corinthians 11:17
Paul says: I am bragging like a silly man now, not like Jesus wants. 🙈
## 2 Corinthians 11:18
Paul says: Many people brag in a human way. I will brag too. 😐
## 2 Corinthians 11:19
Paul says: You think you are wise, and you put up with silly men! 🙃
## 2 Corinthians 11:20
Paul says: You let people boss you, take from you, act big, and even hit you. 😠✋
## 2 Corinthians 11:21
Paul says: I say this with shame. We were too weak for that! But if others brag, I can brag too. 😔➡️💪
## 2 Corinthians 11:22
Paul says: Are they from God’s old family? I am too. Are they from Israel’s big family? I am too. Are they from Abraham’s family? I am too. 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦⭐
## 2 Corinthians 11:23
Paul says: Do they serve Jesus? I serve Him more. I worked more. I was in jail more. I was hit many times. I was near death many times. ✝️⛓️⚠️
## 2 Corinthians 11:24
Paul says: Five times my own people hit me with whips, 39 hits each time. 😣🥀
## 2 Corinthians 11:25
Paul says: Three times men hit me with sticks. One time people threw rocks at me. Three times my ship broke. I was in the sea a long time. 🪵🪨⛵🌊
## 2 Corinthians 11:26
Paul says: I traveled a lot. I faced danger in rivers, from bad men, from my own people, from other people, in towns, in wild land, at sea, and from fake brothers. 🧭⚠️
## 2 Corinthians 11:27
Paul says: I worked hard. Many nights I did not sleep. I was hungry and thirsty. I had little food. I was cold. I had no coat sometimes. 😴🍞🥶
## 2 Corinthians 11:28
Paul says: Every day I feel care for all the churches. 💒❤️
## 2 Corinthians 11:29
Paul says: When someone is weak, I feel weak too. When someone falls, I feel upset. 🤝😢
## 2 Corinthians 11:30
Paul says: If I must brag, I will brag about my weak parts. 💬➡️💔
## 2 Corinthians 11:31
Paul says: God, the Father of the Lord Jesus, knows I do not lie. ✝️🙏
## 2 Corinthians 11:32
Paul says: In one city, the leader kept the gates to grab me. 🚪👮
## 2 Corinthians 11:33
Paul says: But friends put me in a basket and let me down a wall. I got away. 🧺🏰➡️🏃


## 2 Corinthians 12:1
Paul says, I must tell more. It is not good to brag, but God showed me big things. 📖✨
## 2 Corinthians 12:2
Paul says, I know a man with Christ. 14 years ago, he went up to heaven with God. ☁️⬆️🙏
## 2 Corinthians 12:3
Paul says, I do not know if he was in his body or not. God knows. 🤷‍♂️✨
## 2 Corinthians 12:4
He went to God’s home. He heard words too good to say. 🌿🏠👂
## 2 Corinthians 12:5
I can brag about that man. But I will not brag about me. I will tell about my weak self. 🙅‍♂️💬
## 2 Corinthians 12:6
If I brag, I will say what is true. But I will not. I want you to see me by what I do and say. 👀✅
## 2 Corinthians 12:7
God let me have a hard hurt, like a thorn. It keeps me weak, so I do not get proud. 🌵😣
## 2 Corinthians 12:8
I asked the Lord 3 times to take it away. 🙏3️⃣
## 2 Corinthians 12:9
<jesus>My help is enough for you. My power works best when you are weak.</jesus> So I am glad to talk about my weak self. Then His power can rest on me. ✝️💪😊
## 2 Corinthians 12:10
So I am glad in weak and hard times, for Jesus. When I am weak, then I am strong with Him. 😊💔➡️💪
## 2 Corinthians 12:11
I talked like a fool, but you made me. You should say good of me. I am not less than the big leaders, even if I am like nothing. 🗣️😔
## 2 Corinthians 12:12
God used me to do true signs. God did wonders and big works with me. ✨🙌
## 2 Corinthians 12:13
You were not less than other groups. I did not make you pay me. Please forgive me for this. 🤝
## 2 Corinthians 12:14
I will come to you again, a third time. I will not take your money. I want you, not your things. Parents save for kids, not kids for parents. 🧳3️⃣❤️👨‍👩‍👧‍👦
## 2 Corinthians 12:15
I will give all I have for you. I will give myself too. I love you more and more. Will you love me less? 💝🫶
## 2 Corinthians 12:16
Some say, “Paul did not take money, but he tricked us!” They say I used a trick. 🕵️‍♂️
## 2 Corinthians 12:17
Did I use any worker I sent to you to take from you? ❓
## 2 Corinthians 12:18
I asked Titus to go. He went with a brother. He did not take from you. We walked the same good way. 🚶‍♂️🚶‍♂️👍
## 2 Corinthians 12:19
Do you think I talk just to make me look good? No. We talk before God with Jesus. We talk to help you grow strong in Jesus. 🙏⬆️
## 2 Corinthians 12:20
I fear I may find you not how I want. I may see fights, mad hearts, mean words, bad talk, proud ways, and a big mess. 😟⚠️
## 2 Corinthians 12:21
I fear God may make me sad when I come. I may cry for many who did bad and did not stop. Please say sorry and stop the bad. 😢🙏⛔


## 2 Corinthians 13:1
Paul said, “This is my third time to come to you. Two or three people must say the same thing to make it sure.” 🚶‍♂️3️⃣🗣️🗣️🗣️
## 2 Corinthians 13:2
Paul said, “I told you before when I was there. I say it now while I am away. If I come again, I will not let the bad keep going for the ones who did wrong.” ✍️⚠️🚫
## 2 Corinthians 13:3
You want to see that Jesus speaks in me. Jesus is not weak with you. He is strong with you. ✝️💬💪

Jesus died on a cross. He looked weak. But God made Him alive. We are weak with Him, but we will live with Him by God’s power to help you. ✝️😔✨💪🤝
## 2 Corinthians 13:5
All of you, look at your own hearts. Test yourselves. Ask, “Do I trust Jesus? Is Jesus in me?” Do not fail the test. 🔎❤️❓✅
## 2 Corinthians 13:6
I hope you will see we did not fail. 👀🤞
## 2 Corinthians 13:7
We pray to God that you do no bad. We do not pray so we look good. We pray so you do good, even if we look weak. 🙏🚫👍
## 2 Corinthians 13:8
We can not fight what is true. We can only help what is true. 🛡️✔️
## 2 Corinthians 13:9
We are glad when we are weak and you are strong. We pray you get strong and good. 🙂💪🙏

May the Lord Jesus be kind to you. May God’s love be with you. May God’s Holy Spirit help all of you be one. ✝️😊❤️🕊️👫👬


## Galatians 1:1
Paul says, I am Paul. Jesus sent me. People did not send me. God the Father made Him live again. ✍️✝️✨
## Galatians 1:2
My friends are with me. We write to the church groups in Galatia. 👋📝
## Galatians 1:3
I ask God our Father and the Lord Jesus to be kind to you and give you peace. 🙏🕊️
## Galatians 1:4
Jesus gave His life to take away our wrong. He saved us from bad in this world. This was what God wanted. ✝️❤️🌍
## Galatians 1:5
We say, Yay God, for always! 🌟🙌
## Galatians 1:6
I am surprised. You turn from God, who called you to Jesus. You go to a different good news. 😮➡️
## Galatians 1:7
There is no other good news. Some people make you mixed up. They change the good news about Jesus. 🚫🔀
## Galatians 1:8
If we, or even an angel, say a new good news, do not listen. That is very bad. 🚫👂
## Galatians 1:9
I say it again: if anyone tells a new good news, do not listen. That is very bad. 🔁🚫
## Galatians 1:10
Do I try to make people happy, or God? I want to make God happy. If I just make people happy, I am not Jesus’ helper. ❤️‍🔥🙅‍♂️
## Galatians 1:11
Family, hear me: the good news I tell you is not from people. 🗣️📖
## Galatians 1:12
No one taught me this. Jesus showed me. ✝️👀
## Galatians 1:13
You heard about me before. I hurt God’s church. I tried to stop it. 😔💔
## Galatians 1:14
I did very well in my old way. I loved old rules more than many my age. 🧠🏃‍♂️
## Galatians 1:15
But God chose me before I was born. He was kind and called me. 👶✨
## Galatians 1:16
God showed His Son to me. I should tell people in all places about Him. I did not ask people first. 🌍🗣️
## Galatians 1:17
I did not go to Jerusalem then. I went to Arabia. Then I went back to Damascus. 🧭🚶‍♂️
## Galatians 1:18
After 3 years, I went to Jerusalem. I met Peter and stayed 15 days. ⏳🤝
## Galatians 1:19
I did not see the other helpers. I only saw James, Jesus’ brother. 👋
## Galatians 1:20
I tell the truth. God knows I do not lie. ✋🙏
## Galatians 1:21
Then I went to Syria and Cilicia. 🗺️
## Galatians 1:22
The churches in Judea did not know me by face yet. 🚶‍♂️👀
## Galatians 1:23
They only heard, “The man who hurt us now tells the faith he tried to stop.” 🔁✨
## Galatians 1:24
They praised God because of me. 🙌❤️


## Galatians 2:1
After 14 years, Paul went to Jerusalem with Barnabas. He took Titus too. 🚶‍♂️🏙️👬
## Galatians 2:2
God told Paul to go. Paul told the big helpers the Good News he tells to not-Jew people. He spoke in a small, quiet group to check his work. 🗣️🤝🔍
## Galatians 2:3
They did not make Titus do the old body rule. ✅🙂
## Galatians 2:4
Some fake friends came in like sneaks. They tried to take our free life in Jesus and make us follow old rules. 🕵️‍♂️🔒
## Galatians 2:5
We did not give in. Not even a little. We kept the true Good News for you. ⛔💪📖
## Galatians 2:6
The big leaders did not change Paul’s message. God does not pick favorites. 🤝⚖️
## Galatians 2:7
They saw God gave Paul work to tell not-Jew people. Peter would tell Jew people. 👥➡️🌍✡️
## Galatians 2:8
God helped Peter with Jew people. God helped Paul with not-Jew people too. 🙌✨
## Galatians 2:9
James, Peter (also called Cephas), and John saw God helped Paul. They shook hands with Paul and Barnabas. Paul would go to not-Jew people. They would go to Jew people. 🤝🙂🌎✡️
## Galatians 2:10
They said, “Please help poor people.” Paul wanted to do this. 🧺🤲❤️
## Galatians 2:11
Peter came to Antioch. Paul told Peter to his face, “You are wrong.” ⚠️👥
## Galatians 2:12
Before men from James came, Peter ate with not-Jew friends. When they came, he pulled away. He was scared of the old rule group. 🍽️➡️🚶‍♂️😟
## Galatians 2:13
Other Jew friends did the same fake thing. Even Barnabas followed them. 😕➡️👥
## Galatians 2:14
Paul saw they did not live the true Good News. He said to Peter in front of all, “You are a Jew but you live like not-Jews. Do not make not-Jews live like Jews.” 🗣️👥📢
## Galatians 2:15
We are Jews. We are not from the not-Jew group people call bad. 👥✡️
## Galatians 2:16
We know God makes us right, not by old rules, but when we trust Jesus Christ. So we trust Jesus. No one is made right by old rules. ❤️✝️✅
## Galatians 2:17
If we look to Jesus to make us right and we still do wrong, does Jesus lead us to wrong? No! ❓✝️🚫
## Galatians 2:18
If I go back and build the old rule life, I show I am the rule breaker. 🔁🏗️⚠️
## Galatians 2:19
The old rules showed me I cannot be saved by them. So I stopped living by old rules. Now I live for God. 📜✝️➡️🙏
## Galatians 2:20
I died with Jesus on the cross. Now Jesus lives in me. My life now is by trust in God’s Son. He loved me. He gave His life for me. ✝️❤️🙏
## Galatians 2:21
I do not push away God’s gift. If old rules could make us right, then Jesus died for nothing. 🎁✝️


## Galatians 3:1
Paul said to all of you in Galatia: You are not thinking well. Who tricked you? You saw Jesus on the cross. ✝️🤔
## Galatians 3:2
Paul said: Did you get God's Holy Spirit by doing rules? Or by hearing and trusting? 👂❤️🕊️
## Galatians 3:3
You started with God's Holy Spirit. Will you try to finish by your own self now? 🕊️➡️💪
## Galatians 3:4
Did you have hard times for Jesus for nothing? 😞✝️
## Galatians 3:5
God gives God's Holy Spirit and does big works. Did He do this from rules? Or from hearing and trusting? 🕊️✨👂❤️
## Galatians 3:6
Abraham trusted God. God said, That is good. 👍🙏
## Galatians 3:7
So, people who trust are like kids of Abraham. 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦❤️
## Galatians 3:8
The Bible said long ago: God will call people who are not Jews good by trust. God told Abraham, “All groups will get good from you.” 📖🌍🙂
## Galatians 3:9
So all who trust get good with Abraham, who trusted. 😊🤝
## Galatians 3:10
If you try to be right by rules, it is a bad thing. The Bible says, “Bad for all who do not do all the rules all the time.” ⚠️📖
## Galatians 3:11
No one is made right with God by rules. The Bible says, “The good person lives by trust.” 📖❤️
## Galatians 3:12
The rules are not trust. The rules say, “Do the rules to live.” 📜➡️👣
## Galatians 3:13
Jesus took the bad for us. He died on the cross tree for us. Now we are free. ✝️🕊️
## Galatians 3:14
This was so all people can get the good like Abraham, in Christ Jesus. We get God's Holy Spirit by trust. 🌍😊🕊️
## Galatians 3:15
Paul said: Think of a deal people make. When it is set, people do not change it. 🤝✍️
## Galatians 3:16
God made a promise to Abraham and to one child. It did not say many kids. The one child is Christ. 👶➡️Christ
## Galatians 3:17
The rules came 430 years later. The rules did not stop God's promise. 430 ⏳➡️📜❌
## Galatians 3:18
If the gift came by rules, it is not by promise. But God gave it to Abraham by a promise. 🎁➡️📜
## Galatians 3:19
Why the rules? The rules showed wrong. The rules were for a time, until the one child came. Angels used a helper to give the rules. ⛔⏳👼🤝
## Galatians 3:20
A helper stands between two. But God is one. 1️⃣
## Galatians 3:21
Are the rules against God's promise? No. If rules could give life, rules would make us right. ❓➡️❌📜
## Galatians 3:22
The Bible says we all do wrong. So the promise comes by trust in Jesus Christ to all who trust. 📖➡️❌… then ❤️ in Christ
## Galatians 3:23
Before trust came, the rules held us, like in a hold, until trust came. ⛓️⏳➡️❤️
## Galatians 3:24
The rules were like a teacher guard until Christ came. Then we are made right by trust. 🛡️👩‍🏫➡️Christ❤️
## Galatians 3:25
Now trust is here. We are not under the guard now. ❤️🕊️
## Galatians 3:26
In Christ Jesus, all of you are God's kids by trust. 👑👶❤️
## Galatians 3:27
All of you who were put in water into Christ put on Christ, like new clothes. 💧➡️Christ👕
## Galatians 3:28
In Christ Jesus, all of you are one. It does not matter if you are Jew or not, slave or free, boy or girl. We are one in Him. 🤝❤️
## Galatians 3:29
If you belong to Christ, you are like kids of Abraham. You get the gift God promised. 🎁👨‍👩‍👧‍👦


## Galatians 4:1
Paul said: A child who will get the home is like a worker for now. He is not free yet. 👦🏠⏳
## Galatians 4:2
The child must obey helpers and a teacher until Dad says, “Now.” 👨‍👩‍👦🧑‍🏫🗓️
## Galatians 4:3
We were like kids too. Old rules held us like a chain. ⛓️👧👦
## Galatians 4:4
When the time was just right, God sent His Son, Jesus. He was born as a baby. ⏰👶✝️
## Galatians 4:5
Jesus came to set us free and make us God’s kids. Jesus is God’s Son. Jesus loves us. 🕊️❤️
## Galatians 4:6
God sent God’s Holy Spirit into your hearts. We cry, “Abba, Father!” 💖🕊️🗣️
## Galatians 4:7
You are not a slave now. You are God’s child. You will get His good gifts. 😀🎁
## Galatians 4:8
Before, you did not know God. You served things that were not God. 😕🛑
## Galatians 4:9
Now you know God, and God knows you. Why go back to small, weak rules? 🔁❌
## Galatians 4:10
You watch special days and months and times and years like they can save you. 📅🗓️⛔
## Galatians 4:11
I am afraid my work for you may be for nothing. 😟
## Galatians 4:12
Friends, be like me. I was like you. You did not hurt me. 🤝🙂
## Galatians 4:13
You know I was sick when I came. I told you the good news then. 🤒🗣️
## Galatians 4:14
You did not make fun of me. You were kind. You welcomed me like an angel, like I was with Jesus. 😊👼
## Galatians 4:15
Where is your joy now? Back then you would give me your eyes if you could. 😢👀
## Galatians 4:16
Am I your enemy now because I tell you the truth? 😔
## Galatians 4:17
Those people are nice to you, but not to help you. They want to pull you away. They want you to like them most. 🚫🧲
## Galatians 4:18
It is good to be excited for a good thing, not just when I am there. 👍😊
## Galatians 4:19
My little ones, I hurt like a mom having a baby, until Jesus grows in you. 👶💗
## Galatians 4:20
I wish I was there with you now. I would talk soft. I do not know what to do. 🙏🤷
## Galatians 4:21
You who want the old rules, listen to what the Book says. 📖👂
## Galatians 4:22
Long ago, a man named Abraham had two sons. One mom was a helper. One mom was free. 👨‍👩‍👦‍👦
## Galatians 4:23
The helper mom had a boy in the normal way. The free mom had a boy because God made a promise. 👶✨
## Galatians 4:24
This is like a picture: the helper mom shows a life with hard rules that makes people not free. 🧱⛓️
## Galatians 4:25
That rule life makes many kids not free. They feel stuck. 🚫⛓️
## Galatians 4:26
But the free mom is like a picture of God’s home above. She is free. We are her kids. 🕊️🏠⬆️
## Galatians 4:27
The Book says, “Be glad, mom with no kids. You will have many kids.” 🎉👩‍🍼
## Galatians 4:28
Family, you are like Isaac. You are kids of God’s promise. 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦🌟
## Galatians 4:29
Back then, the helper mom’s boy was mean to the free mom’s boy. Now it is like that too. 😠➡️😢
## Galatians 4:30
The Book says, “Send the helper mom and her boy away. The free mom’s boy gets the gift.” 🚪🎁
## Galatians 4:31
So, family, we are not kids of the helper. We are kids of the free mom. We are free in Jesus. 🕊️❤️


## Galatians 5:1
Paul says: Jesus made you free. Stand strong. Do not wear the old rule chain again. 🕊️⛓️❌
## Galatians 5:2
Paul says: If you pick the old cut rule, then you do not take Jesus’ help. ✋✝️
## Galatians 5:3
Paul says: If you pick that one old cut rule, you must keep all the old rules. 📜➡️📜📜📜
## Galatians 5:4
Paul says: If you try to be right by old rules, you move away from Jesus’ gift. 😔✝️
## Galatians 5:5
By God's Holy Spirit, we wait and trust God to make us right. We hope in Him. 🕊️⏳🙏
## Galatians 5:6
In Jesus, the cut rule or no cut rule does not count. Trust that shows in love counts. ❤️🙌
## Galatians 5:7
You were running well. Who stopped you from the truth? 🏃‍♂️❓
## Galatians 5:8
This push did not come from God. ⚠️🙏
## Galatians 5:9
A little bad can spread, like a tiny yeast in bread. 🍞🧡➡️🟠
## Galatians 5:10
Paul trusts the Lord: you will choose right. The one who tricks you will get in trouble. 😊🙏⚖️
## Galatians 5:11
Paul says: If I said the old cut rule is needed, why do people hurt me? The cross of Jesus would not bother them then. ❓✝️
## Galatians 5:12
Paul says: I wish the ones who upset you would stop and go away. 😠🚫
## Galatians 5:13
Family, God called you to be free; do not use free to do bad wants. Use love and help each other. 🕊️❤️🤝
## Galatians 5:14
All the rules are in one big rule: Love your neighbor like you love you. ❤️👫
## Galatians 5:15
Do not fight and hurt each other, or you all will get hurt. 🐺❌
## Galatians 5:16
Live by God's Holy Spirit, and you will not do bad wants. 🚶‍♂️🕊️❌
## Galatians 5:17
Bad wants and God's Holy Spirit pull apart and fight, so you do not do what you want. ⚔️🕊️
## Galatians 5:18
If God's Holy Spirit leads you, old rules are not your boss. 🕊️➡️🙂
## Galatians 5:19
The bad acts are clear: bad love, dirty acts, wild life. ❌💔😵
## Galatians 5:20
More bad acts: false gods, bad magic, hate, big fights, jealous, mad fits, me-first groups. ❌🗿✨😡🧨
## Galatians 5:21
More bad acts: envy, drink too much, wild parties, and more; people who keep doing these will not be in God’s family home. ❌🍺🎉
## Galatians 5:22
The good fruit from God's Holy Spirit is love, joy, peace, wait, kind, good, and trust God. 🍎🕊️❤️😊✌️⏳🤝
## Galatians 5:23
More good fruit: soft care, can say no to bad; no rule is against these. 🌷✋❌
## Galatians 5:24
People who belong to Christ Jesus say no to bad wants and put them away. ✝️🧹
## Galatians 5:25
If God's Holy Spirit gives us life, let us walk with God's Holy Spirit each day. 🕊️🚶‍♀️
## Galatians 5:26
Do not brag, do not pick fights, do not want what others have. 🚫😤👊👀


## Galatians 6:1
Paul says: If a friend does wrong, you who live by God's Holy Spirit help the friend come back. Be gentle. Watch your own self too. 👥🙏💛
## Galatians 6:2
Help each other with hard things. This is what Jesus wants. 🤝💪❤️
## Galatians 6:3
Do not think you are a big boss. Do not trick your own self. 🚫😕
## Galatians 6:4
Check your own work. Be glad when you do right. Do not compare to others. ✅🙂
## Galatians 6:5
Each one must carry his own stuff. 🎒
## Galatians 6:6
If you learn God’s word, share good things with your teacher. 🍞🎁👩‍🏫
## Galatians 6:7
Do not be tricked. No one can make fun of God. What you plant is what you get. 🌱➡️🌾
## Galatians 6:8
If you plant bad self stuff, you get bad, it dies. If you plant good and live by God's Holy Spirit, you get life that lasts with God. 🌱❌ / 🌱✅➡️🌤️
## Galatians 6:9
Do not stop doing good. At the right time we will get a good gift, if we do not quit. ⏰👍🎁
## Galatians 6:10
So, when we can, do good to all people, and extra good to God’s family who trust Jesus. 👫🌍💖
## Galatians 6:11
Look! I, Paul, write this part with big letters. ✍️🔠
## Galatians 6:12
Some people want to look good to others. They push you to do a body rule so they will not get hurt for Jesus on the cross. 😕👉✂️➡️😣✝️
## Galatians 6:13
Those same people do not keep all the rules. They still want you to do that body rule so they can brag. 🚫📏😬
## Galatians 6:14
I, Paul, will not brag. I only brag about Jesus on the cross. Because of Jesus, the bad world is like dead to me, and I am like dead to that bad world. ✝️❤️
## Galatians 6:15
That body rule or no body rule does not make you good. What matters is a new you from God. 🌟🆕
## Galatians 6:16
May God give peace and kind help to all who live this way, and to God’s people. 🕊️🤍
## Galatians 6:17
From now on, do not give me trouble. I have marks on my body for Jesus. ✝️💪
## Galatians 6:18
May our Lord Jesus be kind to you inside. Amen. 🙏❤️

## 1 Timothy 1:3
Paul says, Stay in Ephesus. Tell some people to stop wrong teach. 🏙️✋📖
## 1 Timothy 1:4
Do not like fake stories or long name lists. They make guess talk. Do the work God wants by trust. 📚🚫🤔➡️🙏
## 1 Timothy 1:5
Our goal is love. We show God’s love from a clean heart, a good mind, and real trust. ❤️🫶🫀
## 1 Timothy 1:6
Some people left this way. They talk about silly things. 🌀💬
## 1 Timothy 1:7
They want to be teachers of rules, but they do not understand. 🎓❓
## 1 Timothy 1:8
God’s rules are good when we use them right. ✅📜
## 1 Timothy 1:9
Rules are not for good people. Rules are for bad people who do not obey, who do not love God, who hit mom or dad, and who kill. 🚫👊👩‍👦⚠️
## 1 Timothy 1:10
Rules are for people who do very wrong with their bodies, who steal people, who lie, who tell big lies, and for any bad thing not in true teaching. 🚫🧍‍♂️🧍‍♀️🗣️❌
## 1 Timothy 1:11
This fits the good news about our great God. God gave this job to me. 📣🙌
## 1 Timothy 1:12
I thank Christ Jesus. He made me strong. He chose me to work for Him. 🙏💪
## 1 Timothy 1:13
Before, I said bad of God. I hurt His people. I was mean. But God was kind to me. I did not know, and I did not trust. 😔➡️😊
## 1 Timothy 1:14
Our Lord Jesus was very, very kind to me. He gave me trust and God’s love. 🥰🌊
## 1 Timothy 1:15
This is true: Christ Jesus came to save people who do wrong. I was the worst. ✝️🆘
## 1 Timothy 1:16
God was kind to me so Jesus could show big patience. Then other people can trust Him and have life with God that never ends. ⏳❤️🌟
## 1 Timothy 1:17
Praise to the King for all time. He never dies. We cannot see Him. He is the one God. Praise Him forever! 👑✨🙏
## 1 Timothy 1:18
Timothy, my child, I give you this job. People spoke God’s words about you before. Be strong and brave for God. 🧒📝🛡️
## 1 Timothy 1:19
Keep your trust and a clean heart. Some did not. Their trust crashed like a ship. 🚢💥
## 1 Timothy 1:20
Two are Hymenaeus and Alexander. I handed them to Satan, so they learn not to say bad of God. ⚠️🗣️❌

God wants all people to be saved. God wants all to know what is true. 🌍✅

There is one God. There is one helper between God and us. He is Jesus Christ. Jesus is God’s Son. Jesus helps us. 1️⃣✝️🤝

Jesus gave His life for all people. This good news came at the right time. ✝️💖⏰

Do good things. This shows you love God. 🤝❤️
## 1 Timothy 2:11
Women should learn in a quiet way. They should listen well. 👂🤫
## 1 Timothy 2:12
Paul says: I do not let a woman teach a man or boss a man. She should be quiet. 🧑‍🏫🚫🤫
## 1 Timothy 2:13
God made Adam first. Later God made Eve. 🧑➡️👩
## 1 Timothy 2:14
The snake tricked Eve. Adam was not tricked then. Eve did wrong. 🐍😢
## 1 Timothy 2:15
But God will help women when they have babies, if they keep faith, have God’s love, live holy, and stay calm. 👶🙏❤️✨🙂


## 1 Timothy 3:1
Paul says: This is true. If a man wants to be a church leader, he wants a good work. ⛪⭐💪
## 1 Timothy 3:2
So the church leader must be very good. He has one wife. He thinks clear and stays calm. He is neat and kind. He opens his home to guests. He can teach. 👍💍🧠😌🧼🤝🏠📖
## 1 Timothy 3:3
He is not a drunk. He is not a fighter. He is gentle. He does not fight with words. He does not love money. 🚫🍷🚫🥊🙂🕊️💬❌💰
## 1 Timothy 3:4
He leads his home well. His kids obey with respect. 🏠👨‍👩‍👧‍👦✅🙏
## 1 Timothy 3:5
If a man can not lead his own home, how can he care for God’s church? ❓🏠➡️⛪
## 1 Timothy 3:6
He must not be new to the faith. If he is new, he may get a big head and fall. The devil will like that. 🚫🆕🙏😕⬇️😈
## 1 Timothy 3:7
He must be known as good by people outside the church. Then he will not fall into a trap of the devil. 🙂👥⛪➡️🚫🪤😈
## 1 Timothy 3:8
Church helpers must be good too. They do not say one thing and then another. They do not drink too much. They do not want money in a bad way. ⛪🧑‍🤝‍🧑👍🗣️↔️🚫🍷💸❌
## 1 Timothy 3:9
They keep the true news of Jesus in their hearts. They stay clean inside. ❤️📖✝️🧼
## 1 Timothy 3:10
Test them first. If they show they are good, then let them help. 🧪⏳✅🤝
## 1 Timothy 3:11
The women who help must be good too. They do not talk in a mean way. They are calm. They tell the truth. 👩‍🦰🤝👍🚫🗣️😠😌✔️
## 1 Timothy 3:12
A church helper must have one wife. He must lead his kids and home well. ⛪🤝💍👨‍👩‍👧‍👦🏠✅
## 1 Timothy 3:13
If helpers do well, people will respect them. They will feel brave to talk about trust in Christ Jesus. 🏅🙂👥🗣️✝️💬💪
## 1 Timothy 3:14
I, Paul, write these things to you, Timothy. I hope I can come to you soon. 📝➡️👦⏳💭🙂
## 1 Timothy 3:15
If I am slow, you will know how to act in God’s family, the church of the God who is alive. The church holds up the true word. 🐢⏱️👨‍👩‍👧‍👦⛪📖🧱⬆️
## 1 Timothy 3:16
This is a big true thing about Jesus: He came as a man. God’s Holy Spirit said He is right. Angels saw Him. People told about Him in many lands. Many in the world believed in Him. He went up to heaven in great light. ✨👶🕊️👼🗺️🗣️🌍✅⬆️🌟


## 1 Timothy 4:1
God's Holy Spirit says that later, some people will stop following God. They will listen to bad spirits and lies. 🕊️⚠️👂❌
## 1 Timothy 4:2
These people tell lies. Their hearts feel hard. They do not care. 😞🗣️❌💔
## 1 Timothy 4:3
They say, “Do not marry.” They say, “Do not eat some food.” But God made food. People who trust God can eat with thanks. 🚫💍🚫🍲🙏
## 1 Timothy 4:4
All that God made is good. We should not say “no” to good food when we thank God. 🍎👍🙏
## 1 Timothy 4:5
God’s word and prayer make the food good and clean. 📖🙏🍽️
## 1 Timothy 4:6
Paul says, “Timothy, tell the church these things. Then you will be a good helper of Jesus. You learn the true words and follow them.” 🧑‍🏫⛪✝️👍
## 1 Timothy 4:7
Do not listen to silly made-up stories. Practice to live God’s way. 🙉📖💪
## 1 Timothy 4:8
Body practice helps a little. Living God’s way helps in all life, now and later. 🏃‍♂️💪➡️🙏🌟
## 1 Timothy 4:9
This word is true. All should say yes to it. ✅🗣️
## 1 Timothy 4:10
We work hard and keep going. We hope in the living God. He saves all people, most of all the ones who believe. 💪⏳🙏🕊️
## 1 Timothy 4:11
Teach these things. Tell the people to do them. 🗣️📚
## 1 Timothy 4:12
You are young. Do not let them look down on you. Be a good example for the church: in talk, in how you live, in God’s love, in faith, and in a clean life. 🧒✨🗣️👣❤️🙏🧼
## 1 Timothy 4:13
Until I come, read God’s book to the people. Help them. Teach them. 📖⛪🗣️
## 1 Timothy 4:14
Do not forget the gift God gave you. The church leaders put hands on you and prayed. 🎁👐⛪🙏
## 1 Timothy 4:15
Think about these jobs. Do them all the time. Then all can see you get better. 🤔⏰✅👀⬆️
## 1 Timothy 4:16
Watch your life and your teaching. Keep doing this. You will help you and the ones who listen. 👀❤️🧠👂✅


## 1 Timothy 5:1
Paul told Timothy: Do not be hard on an old man. Talk nice, like to a dad. 👴❤️
## 1 Timothy 5:2
Paul told Timothy: Treat old women like moms. Treat young women like sisters. Keep your heart clean. 👵👧💖
## 1 Timothy 5:3
Paul said: Help women with no husband who are truly alone. 🤲👩
## 1 Timothy 5:4
If she has kids or grandkids, they should help her at home first. This makes God glad. 🏠👧👦🙂
## 1 Timothy 5:5
A woman alone trusts God. She prays day and night. 🙏🌙☀️
## 1 Timothy 5:6
But if she only wants fun and does bad, this is not good. She is like dead inside. 🎉❌
## 1 Timothy 5:7
Teach these rules so people do not do wrong. 📣✅
## 1 Timothy 5:8
If a man will not care for his own family, he does very wrong. 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦❌
## 1 Timothy 5:9
Put a woman on the help list only if she is 60 or more and was true to one man. 📝6️⃣0️⃣
## 1 Timothy 5:10
She should have done many good things: raised kids, was kind to guests, helped God’s people, and helped sick or sad ones. 🌟👶🏽🏠🤝
## 1 Timothy 5:11
Do not put young women with no husband on the list, because they may want to marry again later. 👩‍🦰❌💍
## 1 Timothy 5:12
Then they would break their first promise. 📝💔
## 1 Timothy 5:13
They may waste time, go house to house, talk too much, and say wrong things. 🚶‍♀️🏠🗣️❌
## 1 Timothy 5:14
So I think young women should marry, have kids, care for the home, and do good so no one can say bad things. 🏡👶🙂
## 1 Timothy 5:15
Some have gone the wrong way with Satan. ⚠️😈
## 1 Timothy 5:16
If a believer has a woman with no husband in the family, they should help her. Then the church can help the ones who are all alone. 👪🤲⛪
## 1 Timothy 5:17
Church leaders who do good work should get extra thanks, most of all the ones who teach God’s word. ⛪👨‍🏫🌟
## 1 Timothy 5:18
God’s book says: Do not stop an ox from eating when it works. A worker should get pay. 📖🐂🍽️💰
## 1 Timothy 5:19
Do not listen to a blame story about a leader unless two or three people saw it. 👂🚫2️⃣3️⃣
## 1 Timothy 5:20
If someone keeps doing wrong, tell it to all, so others learn and stop. ✋📣
## 1 Timothy 5:21
I tell you before God and Jesus and His angels: do these rules the same for all. Do not pick favorites. 🙏✝️😇⚖️
## 1 Timothy 5:22
Do not choose leaders too fast. Do not join in sins. Keep yourself clean. ✋⛪🧼
## 1 Timothy 5:23
Do not drink only water. Use a little wine to help your tummy when you are sick a lot. 🚰➡️🍷🤒
## 1 Timothy 5:24
Some sins are easy to see now. Some sins show up later. 👀🕒
## 1 Timothy 5:25
Good works are seen too. If not now, they will be seen later. 🔦🌟


## 1 Timothy 6:1
Paul says: Workers who must obey a boss should give honor, so God’s name and teaching look good. 👷‍♀️👨‍🏭🙏

## 1 Timothy 6:3
Paul says: If someone teaches a new way that is not what our Lord Jesus said, do not follow it. 🚫📖
## 1 Timothy 6:4
Paul says: That person is proud and does not know. He likes word fights, and this makes people mad and split. 😠🗣️
## 1 Timothy 6:5
Paul says: There is mean talk and fuss. Some think being good is for getting money. This is wrong. 💬💢💰

Paul says: We came with no things, and we leave with no things. 👶➡️⚰️

## 1 Timothy 6:10
Paul says: Loving money too much starts many bad things. Some left trusting God and felt much pain. 💔💰
## 1 Timothy 6:11
Paul says: You, man of God, run from this. Chase what is right: do right, trust God, love, keep going, be gentle. 🏃‍♂️➡️❤️🙏
## 1 Timothy 6:12
Paul says: Fight the good fight of trust in God. Hold life with God that never ends. You said this before many people. 🥊✝️🌟
## 1 Timothy 6:13
Paul says: I tell you this before God, who gives life to all, and before Christ Jesus, who told the truth to Pilate. ✝️👑
## 1 Timothy 6:14
Paul says: Keep this rule clean. Do no wrong. Keep it until Jesus comes again. ⏳👑
## 1 Timothy 6:15
Paul says: God will show this at the right time. God is the only big King, King of all, Lord of all. 👑🌍

## 1 Timothy 6:18
Paul says: Tell them to do good, do many good works, give, and share. 👐🎁
## 1 Timothy 6:19
Paul says: Then they save up good treasure for later and grab real life with God. 🗝️💖
## 1 Timothy 6:20
Paul says: Timothy, keep safe the true gift God gave you. Do not join silly talk. Do not follow people who say they know, but it is not true. 🛡️📖
## 1 Timothy 6:21
Paul says: Some said they know, but they left trusting God. God be kind to all of you. 🙏

## 2 Timothy 2:16

## 2 Timothy 2:17
That bad talk spreads fast and hurts many. Two men do this: Hymenaeus and Philetus. 🗣️⚠️➡️👥
## 2 Timothy 2:18
They say, “People came back to life already.” That is not true. Some people now feel lost. ❌🌅😟

Then they may wake up and get free from the trap of the bad one. The bad one had caught them to make them do what he wants. 🧠✨🕳️🚪


## 2 Timothy 3:1
Paul said hard days will come in the last days. ⏰⛈️

People will love self and love money. They will brag and be proud. They will say bad things of God. They will not obey mom and dad. They will not say thanks. They will not live good. 💔💰😠🙅‍♂️🙅‍♀️
## 2 Timothy 3:3
They will not love. They will not forgive. They will say mean words. They cannot stop doing bad. They will be mean and hurt. They will hate what is good. 😡🗣️🚫❤️
## 2 Timothy 3:4
They will not keep friends. They will be bossy and proud. They will love fun, not God. 🎉>🙏

They will act good, but they say no to God’s power. You stay away from them. 🎭✋
## 2 Timothy 3:6
Some bad people sneak into homes. They trick weak women who feel bad for wrong. They pull them to want bad things. 🏠🕵️‍♂️
## 2 Timothy 3:7
They learn and learn, but they do not know what is true. 📚❓
## 2 Timothy 3:8
Jannes and Jambres fought Moses long ago. These men also fight the truth. Their minds are bad. They do not stand with God. ✋📖
## 2 Timothy 3:9
But they will not go far. All people will see they are wrong, like before. 🔍🚫

But you, Timothy, saw me, Paul. You saw my teaching, my life, my plan, my trust in God, my wait, my love, and how I keep on. 👀❤️

You saw how people hurt me in Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra. I had pain. But the Lord saved me from all. 🏙️😢🙏
## 2 Timothy 3:12
Yes. All who want to live for Christ Jesus will have hard times. People will hurt them. ✝️😭
## 2 Timothy 3:13
Bad people and fakes will get worse and worse. They trick, and they get tricked. 🎭➡️⬇️
## 2 Timothy 3:14
But you, Timothy, keep the things you learned. You know who taught you. 🧠✅
## 2 Timothy 3:15
Since you were a child, you knew God’s Book. It helps you be saved when you believe in Christ Jesus. 👦📖✝️

All of God’s Book came from God. It is good to teach. It shows what is wrong. It shows how to make it right. It trains us to live good. 📖➡️🧭

## Titus 1:2
We hope to live with God for ever. God does not lie. Long ago, God said He would do this. 🌟⏳
## Titus 1:3
At the right time, God let me tell His word. God told me to preach. God saves us. 🕰️📣📖
## Titus 1:4
To Titus, my true son in the same faith: May God the Father and Christ Jesus give you kind gift and peace. 👋💌🕊️
## Titus 1:5
I left you in Crete. Fix what is not set. Pick leaders in each town, like I said. 📍🏝️👨‍👩‍👧‍👦
## Titus 1:6
A leader must be a good man. He has one wife. His kids obey and do not act wild or bad. 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦✅
## Titus 1:7
A leader for God must be very good. Not proud. Not quick mad. Not drink too much. Not fight. Not love money. 🚫😡🍷🥊💰
## Titus 1:8
He must be kind. He likes good. He can stop self. He is fair. He is close to God. He keeps rules. 🏠❤️👍
## Titus 1:9
He holds on to the true word. He can teach the good truth. He can stop people who say wrong. 📚🛡️🗣️
## Titus 1:10
Some people do not obey. They talk empty words. They try to trick. Some push old rules. 🗣️❌🎭
## Titus 1:11
Make them quiet. They hurt homes. They teach wrong to get money. 🤫🏠💔💰
## Titus 1:12
A man from Crete said, “Cretan people lie, act bad, and are lazy and eat too much.” 🧍‍♂️🗣️😕
## Titus 1:13
This is true. Tell them strong words, so they can be strong in trust in God. ✅⚠️💪
## Titus 1:14
Do not follow fake tales or people rules that pull you from the true way. 🚫📕🚫👂
## Titus 1:15
If your heart is clean, many things seem clean. If your heart is bad and you do not trust, nothing seems clean. Your mind and heart are dirty then. 💖✨🧠🫀
## Titus 1:16
Some say, “We know God,” but their acts say “No.” They do not obey. They are not fit to do good work. 🗣️❌🚫🧹


## Titus 2:1
Paul tells Titus: Teach good and true things from God. 📖👂
## Titus 2:2
Paul says: Older men, be calm and good. Control yourself. Trust God. Show God's love. Do not give up. 👴🙏❤️💪
## Titus 2:3
Paul says: Older women, live in a good way. Do not say mean lies. Do not drink too much wine. Teach what is good. 👵🤐🚫🍷👍
## Titus 2:4
Then older women help young women love their husbands and kids. ❤️👩‍🍼
## Titus 2:5
Teach them to control themselves, to have clean hearts, to work at home, to be kind, and to listen to their own husbands, so people will not say bad things about God's word. 🏠🧼😊👂📖
## Titus 2:6
Paul says: Young men, control yourself. 👦💪
## Titus 2:7
Paul tells Titus: You show good by what you do. When you teach, be true and good. 👀👍📖
## Titus 2:8

Do not steal. Be true. Then God's teaching looks good, because God saves us. 🚫👜✅🙏
## Titus 2:11

## Titus 2:13
We wait with hope and look for Jesus to come and show His bright power. Jesus is our great God. He saves us. 👀✨✝️
## Titus 2:14
He gave Himself for us, to take us away from bad and wrong, to make us clean, and to make us His people who love to do good. ❤️🧼👨‍👩‍👧‍👦👍

Paul says: Tell the people to obey leaders. Be ready to do good. 🙏👍
## Titus 3:2
Do not say mean words. Do not fight. Be kind. Be nice to all people. 🙂🤝
## Titus 3:3
We were foolish. We did not listen. We liked bad fun. We were mean, mad, and jealous. We hated, and people hated us. 😞😠
## Titus 3:4
But God is good and kind. God came to help us. ❤️✨
## Titus 3:5
He saved us. Not because we did good. He saved us because He is kind. He washed us clean. God's Holy Spirit made us new. 🚿🕊️💖
## Titus 3:6
God gave us a lot of God's Holy Spirit through Jesus Christ. He saves us. 🕊️🌧️✝️
## Titus 3:7
Now we are right with God by His gift. We will live with God forever. 🤝🌟
## Titus 3:8
Paul says: This is true. Say it again and again. People who trust God must do good. This helps people. ✅🗣️🤝
## Titus 3:9
Do not waste time on silly talk and fights about rules. Do not argue. It does not help. ⛔🗣️⚠️
## Titus 3:10
If a person makes people split and fight, tell him to stop one time. Tell him to stop two times. Then do not be with him. ✋2️⃣🚫
## Titus 3:11
That person is choosing bad. He knows it. He hurts himself. 🙅‍♂️💔
## Titus 3:12
Paul says: I will send Artemas or Tychicus. Please come to me at Nicopolis. I will stay there in winter. 📜👣🏙️❄️
## Titus 3:13
Help Zenas and Apollos go. Give them what they need. 🧳🤝🍞
## Titus 3:14
Teach our people to do good. Help people who need help now. Do not waste time. 🛠️⏰❤️
## Titus 3:15
Friends with me say hi to you. Say hi to friends who love us and trust God. God be kind to all of you. 👋❤️🙏

## Hebrews 1:1
Long ago, God spoke to people many times. He used His helpers, the prophets. 🕰️🗣️📜
## Hebrews 1:2
Now God speaks to us by His Son, Jesus. God made Jesus boss of all. God made the world by Him. Jesus is God’s Son. Jesus loves us. 🌍👑✝️

Jesus is greater than angels. His name is the best. ⭐😇
## Hebrews 1:5
God did not say this to any angel: “You are my Son. I am your Father.” God said this to Jesus. 🗣️👂👑
## Hebrews 1:6
When God sent His Son into the world, God said, “Angels, worship Him.” So angels bow to Jesus. 🌍😇🙏

## Hebrews 1:8
God speaks to the Son: “Your king chair is for always. You rule with what is good.” 👑🪑❤️

## Hebrews 1:14
All angels are helpers. God sends them to help people who will be saved. 😇➡️👨‍👩‍👧‍👦🤝


## Hebrews 2:1
We must listen close to Jesus and His words, so we do not slip away. 👂⚠️
## Hebrews 2:2
Long ago, angels gave a message. It was true. When people broke the rules, they got in trouble. 😇📜✅🚫
## Hebrews 2:3
So do not forget Jesus’ big help to save us. Jesus told it first. People who heard Him told us too. ✝️📣👥
## Hebrews 2:4
God showed it is true with big signs and wow things. God did many great works. God gave gifts from God's Holy Spirit. ✨🙌🎁🕊️
## Hebrews 2:5
The new world to come will not be led by angels. 🌍⏭️🙅‍♂️😇
## Hebrews 2:6
The Bible says, “God, what are people? Why do You think of us?” 🤔🧒
## Hebrews 2:7
You made people a little under angels. You gave people a big job. You set people over the things You made. 😇⬇️🧒👐
## Hebrews 2:8
You let people care for many things. But we do not see all things do what people say yet. 🌎👐⏳
## Hebrews 2:9
But we see Jesus. He was like us for a time. He died for all people. Now He is with God in a high place. ✝️❤️⬆️
## Hebrews 2:10
God made all things. God used Jesus to bring many children to His bright home. Jesus had pain to finish His work. 🌟👧👦🏠✨
## Hebrews 2:11
Jesus makes people clean for God. We are one family. He is not shy to call us His brothers and sisters. 🧼👨‍👩‍👧‍👦😊
## Hebrews 2:12
Jesus says: <jesus>I will tell My family about You, God. I will sing to You with them.</jesus> 🎶👨‍👩‍👧‍👦🙏
## Hebrews 2:13
Jesus says: <jesus>I will trust God.</jesus> <jesus>Here I am, and here are the kids God gave Me.</jesus> 🙏👋👧👦
## Hebrews 2:14
The children are human. So Jesus became human too. He died to break the devil, the boss of death. 🧒🧍‍♂️✝️😈💥
## Hebrews 2:15
Jesus set people free from fear. They were scared of death all their life. He makes them free. 😨➡️😊🔓
## Hebrews 2:16
Jesus did not come to help angels. He came to help people, the family of Abraham. 😇🚫✅👨‍👩‍👧‍👦
## Hebrews 2:17
So Jesus became like His family in every way. He is a kind and true High Priest (top helper to God). He paid for the people’s wrongs. 🤝❤️⛪️✝️
## Hebrews 2:18
Jesus had pain. Bad ideas came to Him, but He said no. Now He can help us when bad ideas come. 😢🍪🙅‍♂️🤝


## Hebrews 3:1
Dear God friends, God called you. Think about Jesus. He is the One God sent. He helps us talk to God. 🙏👀
## Hebrews 3:2
Jesus did the work God gave Him. He did it all. Moses did that too, in God’s house. ✅🏠
## Hebrews 3:3
Jesus is greater than Moses. The one who builds a house is greater than the house. ⭐🏠
## Hebrews 3:4
A house has a builder. God made all things. 🏠🧱🌟
## Hebrews 3:5
Moses was a good helper in God’s house. He told of things that would come later. 🧔📖
## Hebrews 3:6
But Jesus is God’s Son. He is over God’s house. We are His house if we keep on trusting Him to the end. 👑🏠❤️
## Hebrews 3:7
God’s Holy Spirit says, “Today, if you all hear His voice, listen.” 🕊️👂
## Hebrews 3:8
Do not make your hearts hard. Do not fight God, like long ago in the desert. ❌💔🏜️
## Hebrews 3:9
Long ago your dads tested Me. They saw the big things I did for 40 years. ⏳👀
## Hebrews 3:10
So I was not happy with that group. They go the wrong way. They did not know My way. 🚫➡️
## Hebrews 3:11
So I said, “They will not come in to My rest.” 🚫🛌
## Hebrews 3:12
Friends, watch out. Do not let your heart be bad and not believe. Do not walk away from the living God. 👀❤️🚶‍♂️❌
## Hebrews 3:13
But help each other every day while it is Today. Say kind words, so bad sin will not trick you. 🤝🗣️🙂
## Hebrews 3:14
We share with Jesus if we keep our first trust to the end. 🤗✝️
## Hebrews 3:15
As God said, “Today, if you all hear His voice, do not make your hearts hard.” 📣💗
## Hebrews 3:16
Some heard God and still fought Him. Not all who left Egypt with Moses did that. 👂➡️✊
## Hebrews 3:17
Who was God upset with for 40 years? With the ones who did bad. They fell in the desert. 😟🏜️
## Hebrews 3:18
Who did God say could not come into His rest? The ones who did not believe. 🚫🛌
## Hebrews 3:19
So they could not go in, because they did not believe. 🚪❌


## Hebrews 4:1
God made a promise for us to come into His rest. Be careful. Do not miss it. 🛏️😌⚠️
## Hebrews 4:2
We heard good news too. They heard it long ago, but it did not help them, because they did not trust God. 📣👂🙏❌
## Hebrews 4:3
We who trust God go into His rest. But God said to some, “You will not go in.” God made the world long ago, and His work was done. 🛏️✅🌍⏳
## Hebrews 4:4
The book says, “God rested on day seven.” 📖7️⃣🛌
## Hebrews 4:5
God also said, “They will not go into My rest.” 🗣️🚫🛌
## Hebrews 4:6
The rest is still open now. Some did not go in because they did not obey God. 🚪🟢➡️❌
## Hebrews 4:7
God picked a day called “Today.” He said, “Today, if you hear God, do not make your heart hard.” 📅🟢👂❤️🪨
## Hebrews 4:8
If Joshua gave full rest, God would not talk about another day later. So there is more rest to come. 👤🏞️⏭️
## Hebrews 4:9
So there is still a special rest for God’s people. 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦✨🛌
## Hebrews 4:10
When we go into God’s rest, we stop our work, like God stopped His work. 🛌🛑🧰✋
## Hebrews 4:11
So let us try to go in. Do not be like the ones who did not obey God. 💪🚪➡️🙅
## Hebrews 4:12
God’s word is alive and strong. It is like a sharp blade. It shows what is inside us—what we think and feel. 📖💪🔪❤️🧠
## Hebrews 4:13
No one can hide from God. He sees all things. We must tell Him the truth. 👀🌎🚫🫣🗣️
## Hebrews 4:14
We have a big priest. He is Jesus, God’s Son. He went up to Heaven. So keep on trusting Him. ✝️👑⬆️☁️🤲
## Hebrews 4:15
Our big priest cares. He knows our weak parts. He was tested like us, but He did not do wrong. ❤️🤝😓✅
## Hebrews 4:16
So come close to God with brave hearts. God is kind. He gives God’s love and help when we need it. 🧎‍♂️➡️🙏💖🆘


## Hebrews 5:1
Every big priest is a man. He helps people talk to God. He gives gifts to God for bad things. 🙏🎁
## Hebrews 5:2
The big priest is kind to people who do not know and to people who go the wrong way, because he is weak too. 😊➡️🤷‍♀️
## Hebrews 5:3
So the big priest brings gifts for his own bad things too. 🙇‍♂️🎁
## Hebrews 5:4
No man picks this job by himself. God calls him, like God called Aaron. ☎️👆
## Hebrews 5:5
Jesus did not make Himself the big priest. God said, “You are My Son today.” ✝️💬👑
## Hebrews 5:6
God also said, “You are a priest for all time, like Melchizedek long ago.” ⏳⛪
## Hebrews 5:7
When Jesus lived as a man, He prayed loud and cried with tears to God who could save Him from death. God heard Him because He loved and obeyed. 🙏😭🕊️
## Hebrews 5:8
Jesus is God’s Son. He learned to obey by hard times. 👦💙📖
## Hebrews 5:9
After this, Jesus was ready. He saves for all time all who listen to Him and do what He says. ✝️🛟♾️👂✅
## Hebrews 5:10
God named Jesus the big priest, like Melchizedek. 👑⛪
## Hebrews 5:11
We have more to say. It is hard to tell you now, because you do not listen well. 🗣️😕👂
## Hebrews 5:12
By now you should teach. But you need someone to teach you the first easy words from God again. You need milk, not hard food. 🍼🍞🚫
## Hebrews 5:13
If you only drink milk, you are not ready to use God’s word about what is right. You are like a small child. 👶🍼📖
## Hebrews 5:14
But hard food is for big people. They train by practice. They learn to see good and bad. 🍗💪✅❌


## Hebrews 6:1
The writer says: Let us grow up in Jesus. Do not only stay at the start: turn from bad and trust God. 👣✝️
## Hebrews 6:2
Do not do the start list again: learn wash with water, put hands on people to bless, know the dead will live again, and know God will say what is fair at the end. 💧✋🌅⚖️
## Hebrews 6:3
We will do this if God lets us. 🙏➡️
## Hebrews 6:4
It is very hard to help people who saw God’s light, got His good gift, and shared in God’s Holy Spirit. ✨🎁🕊️
## Hebrews 6:5
They heard God’s good word and saw God’s power from the world to come. 📖⚡
## Hebrews 6:6
Then they turn away. It is very hard to help them turn back. They hurt Jesus again and make Him look bad. 🚫↩️✝️😢
## Hebrews 6:7
Land drinks rain. It grows good food for people. God is glad and blesses it. 🌧️🌱🍞
## Hebrews 6:8
But land with thorns is no good. It is near a curse and gets burned. 🌵🔥
## Hebrews 6:9
Dear friends, we think better things for you, things that go with Jesus saving you. 😊
## Hebrews 6:10
God will not forget your kind work. You loved His people, and you still help. ❤️🤝
## Hebrews 6:11
We want each of you to keep trying. Keep your hope strong to the end. 💪⏳
## Hebrews 6:12
Do not be lazy. Copy people who trust God and wait. They get what God said. 🏃‍♀️🙌
## Hebrews 6:13
God made a strong promise to Abraham. God used His own name, the biggest name. 📜✨
## Hebrews 6:14
God said, I will bless you a lot. Your family will be many. 🌟👨‍👩‍👧‍👦👨‍👩‍👧‍👦
## Hebrews 6:15
Abraham waited a long time. Then he got what God said. ⏳✅
## Hebrews 6:16
People use big promises to stop a fight. Then the talk can end. 🗣️🤝
## Hebrews 6:17
God wanted us to be very sure. So He also made a strong promise. 🔒📜
## Hebrews 6:18
God does not lie. He gave two sure things. So we can feel safe. We run to God and hold hope. 🏃‍♂️🫶
## Hebrews 6:19
This hope is like a big boat anchor. It holds us strong. It goes in past the big curtain to God. ⚓⛵⛺
## Hebrews 6:20
Jesus went in first for us. He is our High Priest for all time, like Melchizedek. He helps us with God. ✝️👑


## Hebrews 7:1
Melchizedek was a king in a place named Salem. He was a God helper. He met Abraham after a big fight and blessed him. 👑🏙️🤝🙏
## Hebrews 7:2
Abraham gave Melchizedek one tenth of what he had. Melchizedek’s name means king of right and good, and king of peace. ✋1️⃣0️⃣🕊️
## Hebrews 7:3
We do not read his dad or mom. We do not see his start or end. He is like God’s Son. He is a God helper for ever. 📖❓♾️
## Hebrews 7:4
See how great he was! Abraham, a big man, gave him one tenth. 👀⭐✋1️⃣0️⃣
## Hebrews 7:5
Men from Levi are God helpers too. They take one tenth from the people, who are also from Abraham. 👨‍👦‍👦✋1️⃣0️⃣
## Hebrews 7:6
But Melchizedek was not from Levi. He took one tenth from Abraham and blessed him, the man God gave promises to. 🤝✋1️⃣0️⃣🙏
## Hebrews 7:7
The big one blesses the small one. That is sure. 👍➡️🙂
## Hebrews 7:8
Here, men who die take the tenth. There, it says Melchizedek lives. 🧍⏳➡️✋1️⃣0️⃣ | 🕊️📖
## Hebrews 7:9
In a way, Levi paid too, through Abraham. 🔄✋1️⃣0️⃣
## Hebrews 7:10
Levi was not born yet. He was still in Abraham when Melchizedek met him. 👶⏳🤝
## Hebrews 7:11
The old God helper way did not make all good. So we need a new God helper, like Melchizedek, not like Aaron. 🔄🙏
## Hebrews 7:12
When the God helper job changes, the rule changes too. 🔁📜
## Hebrews 7:13
The One we talk about came from a tribe that did not work at God’s table. 🚫🧍🍞
## Hebrews 7:14
It is clear. Our Lord Jesus came from Judah. Moses did not say men from Judah can be God helpers. ✝️🧬
## Hebrews 7:15
It is even more clear when a new God helper comes, like Melchizedek. 🌟🙏
## Hebrews 7:16
He is a God helper not by family law, but by His strong life that does not end. ♾️💪
## Hebrews 7:17
God says, “You are a God helper for ever, like Melchizedek.” 🗣️📖♾️
## Hebrews 7:18
The old rule was weak. It was put away. 🗑️📜
## Hebrews 7:19
The law did not make us all good. A better hope came. By this we come near to God. 💖➡️🙏
## Hebrews 7:20
All this came with God’s oath, a strong promise. 🤝🗣️
## Hebrews 7:21
Men were God helpers with no oath, but Jesus was made with God’s oath: “The Lord said, You are a God helper for ever.” God will not change His mind. ✝️🗣️♾️
## Hebrews 7:22
So Jesus makes a better deal for us with God. ✝️👍
## Hebrews 7:23
Many old God helpers were there, but they died, so there were many of them. ⚰️➡️👥
## Hebrews 7:24
But Jesus lives for ever. His God helper job stays. ✝️♾️
## Hebrews 7:25
So He can save all who come to God by Him. He lives to speak to God for them all the time. ✝️🙌🗣️🙏
## Hebrews 7:26
We need a Big God Helper like Him. He is holy. He did no wrong. He is clean. He is high in heaven. ✝️✨☁️
## Hebrews 7:27
He does not need to give gifts every day like other big God helpers. He did it once for all. He gave Himself for us. ✝️🎁✅
## Hebrews 7:28
The law picks weak men as big God helpers. But God’s oath picks the Son. He is perfect for ever. ✝️👑♾️


## Hebrews 8:1
The big point: We have a Big Priest. He is Jesus. He sits by God in heaven. ✝️👑⬆️
## Hebrews 8:2
Jesus works in God’s real tent in heaven. God made it, not people. ⛺️✨⬆️
## Hebrews 8:3
Every big priest brings gifts to God. So Jesus has a gift too. 🎁🙌
## Hebrews 8:4
If He was on earth, He would not be a priest here. Other men are priests by the old rules. 🌍📜
## Hebrews 8:5
Those priests work in a copy, like a shadow, of the real place in heaven. God told Moses, Make the tent like the plan I showed you on the mountain. 📄⛺️⛰️
## Hebrews 8:6
But Jesus has a better job. He brings us to God. He brings a better new promise from God. 👍✝️➡️🙏
## Hebrews 8:7
If the first promise worked, we would not need a new one. 1️⃣➡️2️⃣❌
## Hebrews 8:8
God saw the people did not keep it. God says, “I will make a new promise with My people, Israel and Judah.” 👀👥📜✨
## Hebrews 8:9
God says, “It will not be like the old promise I made when I took them from Egypt. They did not keep My promise. I was not happy with them.” 🚶‍♂️🇪🇬❌😞

## Hebrews 8:12
God says, “I will be kind. I will forgive their bad. I will not remember their sins.” 💗🧽🗑️
## Hebrews 8:13
When God says “new,” the old promise is now old. What is old will soon go away. 🆕➡️🧓⏳


## Hebrews 9:1
The old way had rules for God time and a tent church on earth. ⛺📜🙏🌍
## Hebrews 9:2
In the tent, the first room had a lamp and a table with holy bread. It was the Holy Room. 🕯️🍞🪑⛺
## Hebrews 9:3
Behind a second curtain was the Most Holy Room. It was extra special. ⛺🧵🚪✨
## Hebrews 9:4
In there was a gold altar for sweet smoke and a gold box. The box had manna, Aaron’s stick, and the stone rules. 🟨🪙🧴🍞🌿🪨
## Hebrews 9:5
Gold angels were over the mercy lid on the box. The writer did not tell more now. 👼👼🟨
## Hebrews 9:6
Priests went in the first room often to do God’s work. ⛪👨‍⚖️➡️
## Hebrews 9:7
Only the big priest went in the Most Holy Room, one day each year. He took blood for his own sin and for the people. ⛺⛔🗓️1️⃣🩸
## Hebrews 9:8
God’s Holy Spirit showed that the way to God was not open yet while the old tent was still there. 🕊️🚫➡️🙏
## Hebrews 9:9
This was a picture for that time. The gifts and animal blood could not make hearts clean inside. 🎁🐑❌❤️
## Hebrews 9:10
There were rules about food, drink, and washing. These were for a short time only. 🍞🥤🚿⏳
## Hebrews 9:11
But Jesus came as our High Priest of good things. He went in a better tent, not made by people. ✝️👑⛺✨
## Hebrews 9:12
He went in one time and saved us forever. He did not use animal blood. He used His own blood. 1️⃣⏱️🩸❤️
## Hebrews 9:13
Animal blood and ash could make bodies clean on the outside. 🐂🐐🔥🚿
## Hebrews 9:14
Jesus gave Himself to God by God’s Holy Spirit. His blood makes our hearts clean so we can serve the living God. ✝️🕊️🩸❤️✨
## Hebrews 9:15
So Jesus makes the new promise work. He died to free people from wrong. Now they can get God’s forever gift. 🎁✝️🔓⏳
## Hebrews 9:16
A will starts after someone dies. 📜⚰️
## Hebrews 9:17
A will works only after death, not while the person lives. 📜➡️⚰️

So the first promise also used blood. 📜🩸
## Hebrews 9:19
Moses read the rules. Then he put blood and water on the book and on the people. 🧔📖🩸💧

Moses also put blood on the tent and all the tools for God’s work. ⛺🛠️🩸
## Hebrews 9:22
Almost all things were cleaned by blood. No blood means no forgive. 🧽🩸❌
## Hebrews 9:23
The tent on earth was a copy. It used animal blood. The real place in heaven needed better. ⛺🪞➡️🌌✨
## Hebrews 9:24
Jesus went to heaven, to God, for us. He did not go to a man-made tent. ✝️⬆️🌌🛐
## Hebrews 9:25
He did not offer Himself many times. The big priest went in each year with other blood, but not Jesus. 🔁❌✝️
## Hebrews 9:26
Jesus came one time to take away sin by giving Himself. One time was enough. 1️⃣✝️🧹
## Hebrews 9:27
People die one time. After that, God will say what is right. 👤⏳⚰️➡️🗣️
## Hebrews 9:28
Jesus died one time to carry many sins. He will come again to save people who wait for Him. ✝️1️⃣📦➡️⏳🙌


## Hebrews 10:1
The old rules were like a shadow, not the real good thing. Animal gifts each year could not make people clean forever. 🌑🐑🧼❌
## Hebrews 10:2
If those gifts worked, they would stop. People would feel clean and not feel bad for wrong. 🛑😊🧼
## Hebrews 10:3
Those gifts made people remember their wrong each year. 📅🔁😔
## Hebrews 10:4
Bull and goat blood cannot take away wrong. 🐂🐐🩸❌

## Hebrews 10:6
<jesus>You were not glad with animal gifts for wrong.</jesus> 🐏❌
## Hebrews 10:7
<jesus>I am here. I will do what You want, God. It is in the book.</jesus> 📖🙏
## Hebrews 10:8
First, Jesus said God did not want animal gifts, even the ones in the old rules. 🐑📜❌

Then He said again: <jesus>I came to do what You want.</jesus> He ended the old way and made a new way. 🔄✨
## Hebrews 10:10
By what God wants, we are made clean by Jesus’ body. One time. For all. ✝️🧼✅
## Hebrews 10:11
Old priests stood each day and gave many gifts, but those gifts could not take away wrong. 🧍‍♂️📅🎁❌

But Jesus gave one gift for all time, then He sat by God. ✝️🕊️👑
## Hebrews 10:13
He waits till bad people are under His feet. ⏳🦶

By one gift, He made His people clean for all time. 1️⃣🧼♾️

## Hebrews 10:17
God says, “I will not remember their wrong.” 🧽❌

When God forgives, no more gifts for wrong are needed. ✅🎁❌
## Hebrews 10:19
So, family, we can come to God without fear. Jesus’ blood made a way. 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦➡️⛪🩸

It is a new, living way. He opened it by His body, like a curtain opens. ✨🚪

Only fear is left then. God will punish. His fire will stop bad people. 😨🔥
## Hebrews 10:28
Long ago, if people broke Moses’ rules, they died. No kind help. ⚖️😔
## Hebrews 10:29
It is worse if someone hates God’s Son, says His blood is not good, and hurts God’s Holy Spirit. ❌✝️🩸🕊️
## Hebrews 10:30
God says, “I will pay back.” And, “God will punish His people.” 🗣️⚖️

People laughed at you and hurt you. You stood with friends who were hurt too. 😢🤝

People who talk like that want a home with God. 🏠💖

God had a better plan for us too. We will all get it together at the end. 🤝🎁

## Hebrews 12:9
We had dads on earth who taught us, and we listened. We should listen to our Father in heaven and live. 🙏🏽👂
## Hebrews 12:10
Dads teach for a short time. God teaches to help us be good and holy like Him. ⏳✨
## Hebrews 12:11
Teaching does not feel good now. It can hurt. Later it makes good and peace for the ones who learn from it. 😣➡️🕊️

## Hebrews 13:8

## Hebrews 13:9
Do not follow strange new rules. God makes your heart strong by His good gift, not by special food rules. 🍽️🚫❤️

We come to God by Jesus. People who keep the old tent way cannot share this. ⛺✝️
## Hebrews 13:11

James writes. He helps God and the Lord Jesus. He says hi to God’s people far away. ✉️🙋‍♂️✝️
## James 1:2
Be glad when hard days come. They help you grow strong. 😊⛰️
## James 1:3
You know hard time tests your trust. It makes you strong to keep going. 💪
## James 1:4
Keep going till the end. Then you will grow good and not miss any good thing. 🎯🌱
## James 1:5
If you need to know what to do, ask God. He gives to all. He is kind. 🙏🎁
## James 1:6
But when you ask, trust God. Do not wobble like waves in the sea and wind. 🌊💨
## James 1:7
If you are unsure like that, do not think you will get what you ask. 🤔🚫
## James 1:8
A person who cannot choose is not steady in all he does. ↔️🚶‍♂️
## James 1:9
A poor brother can be glad, for God lifts him up. 😊⬆️
## James 1:10
A rich man should feel small, for his rich can go away like a grass flower. 🌼🍃
## James 1:11
The hot sun dries the grass; the flower falls; its pretty look is gone. So the rich man will be gone while he is busy. ☀️🌾🌸➡️🍂
## James 1:12
Happy is the one who keeps going in hard time. God will give life like a bright crown to those who love Him. 😊👑❤️
## James 1:13
When you want to do wrong, do not say, “God makes me do it.” God does not do wrong. He does not make us do wrong. 🚫😈
## James 1:14
We each want wrong things inside. That want pulls us to do wrong. 🎣💔
## James 1:15
Bad want makes sin. Sin grows up. Sin brings death. 🌱➡️🍂⚰️
## James 1:16
My dear family, do not be tricked. 🚫🎭
## James 1:17
All good gifts come from God in heaven. He made the lights in the sky. He does not change. No dark is in Him. 🎁⬇️✨
## James 1:18
God chose to make us new by His true word. He wants us to be His best kids. 📖💡👶
## James 1:19
Be fast to listen. Be slow to talk. Be slow to get mad. 👂🏃‍♂️🗣️🐢😠🐢
## James 1:20
Man anger does not make the right life God wants. 😠🚫✅
## James 1:21
Say no to all bad and dirty ways. Take in God’s word with a soft heart. It can save you. 🗑️🧼❤️📖
## James 1:22
Do what God says. Do not only hear. Do not trick your self. 👂➕👣
## James 1:23
If you hear but do not do, you are like a man who looks in a mirror. 🪞👀
## James 1:24
He looks, then leaves, and he forgets his face. 🚶‍♂️🧠❌
## James 1:25
But if you look at God’s good way and keep on, and you do it, God will make it good for you. 👀📖➡️👣😊
## James 1:26
If you think you love God but do not hold your tongue, you fool your heart. Your worship is no good. 👅❌❤️
## James 1:27
True worship that God our Father likes is this: help kids with no mom or dad, and help women with no husband. Keep your self clean from bad in the world. 🤝👦👧👩🧼🌍


## James 2:1
James says, Do not pick some people as best. You trust our Lord Jesus. He is great. ✝️✨
## James 2:2
James says, A rich man with a gold ring and nice clothes comes in. A poor man with old clothes comes in too. 💍👔🧥
## James 2:3
You give the rich man the good seat, but you tell the poor man, “Stand” or “Sit on the floor.” 🪑➡️🧍‍♂️🧎‍♂️
## James 2:4
James says, That is not fair. You think wrong thoughts. 🙅‍♂️🧠
## James 2:5
Listen, friends. God picks many poor people to trust Him. They get His happy home He said He will give to people who love Him. 🏠💖
## James 2:6
But you were not kind to the poor. The rich are mean to you. They take you to the court. 😠⚖️
## James 2:7
They say bad words about Jesus’ good name. That is not okay. 🚫🗣️✝️
## James 2:8
God’s big rule says, Love your friend next door like you love you. If you do this, you do well. ❤️🤝
## James 2:9
But if you pick who is best, you do wrong. You broke God’s rule. ❌📜
## James 2:10
If you keep all the rules but break one small one, you still broke the rule. 🧩⚠️
## James 2:11
God said, Do not break your marry promise. God also said, Do not kill. If you do not break your marry promise but you kill, you still broke God’s rule. 💔❌🗡️
## James 2:12
So say good and do good. God will look at what you do. 🗣️👍
## James 2:13
If you are not kind, you will not be shown kind. But being kind wins! 😊🏆
## James 2:14
My friend, if you say, “I trust God,” but you do not help, can that help you? No. 🙅‍♂️🤲
## James 2:15
If a friend has no coat and no food, 🧥❌🍞❌
## James 2:16
And you say, “Bye, be warm, eat well,” but you do not give a coat or food, that is no good. 🖐️🥶🍽️❌
## James 2:17
So trust with no help is dead. ⚰️
## James 2:18
You say, “I trust.” I say, “I help.” Show your trust by what you do. I will show my trust by my help. 🫶🤝
## James 2:19
You say, “I know God is one.” Good. Bad angels know this too, and they shake. 😨
## James 2:20
Do you see now? Trust with no help does nothing. 🛑
## James 2:21
Abraham, our helper long ago, obeyed God. He put his son Isaac on the wood for God. 👴🧒🪵
## James 2:22
He trusted God and he acted. His trust and his act worked together. 🤝
## James 2:23
The Book said, “Abraham trusted God.” God was happy with him. He was called God’s friend. 📖😊
## James 2:24
So a person is shown right by what they do and by trust, not by trust alone. ✅🤲
## James 2:25

## James 3:7
James says: People can tame many animals: wild ones, birds, bugs, and fish. 🐅🦅🦎🐟

James says: But if your heart has bitter hate and me-first thinking, do not brag. Do not lie. 💔😠🙅‍♂️

## James 4:1
James asks, “Why do you all fight?” It is from bad wants inside you all. ⚔️😠
## James 4:2
You all want but do not have. You hurt and fight. You still do not have, because you do not ask God. 😣🤛🙏
## James 4:3
You ask but do not get, because you ask for fun things just for you. 🎁🍬

God is the only boss of right and wrong. He can save or stop. You are not the boss. Do not say others are bad. 👑⚖️
## James 4:13
Listen, you who say, “Today or tomorrow we will go to a town and make money.” 🗺️🏙️💰
## James 4:14

You should say, “If the Lord wants, we will live and do it.” 🙏🗓️
## James 4:16
But now you brag and are too proud. This brag is bad. 😏📢🚫
## James 4:17
If you know the good thing to do and do not do it, that is sin. ✅➡️🚫

Are you sad? Pray. Are you happy? Sing to God. 😢🙏 🙂🎶
## James 5:14
Are you sick? Ask the church leaders to come. They will pray and put oil on you in God’s name. 🤒⛪👨‍🦳🧴🙏

Prayer can help the sick get up. God will lift him up. God will forgive the wrong. 🙏⬆️❤️
## James 5:16
Tell each other your wrongs. Pray for each other, so you can get well. A good person’s prayer works big. 🗣️🤝🙏💪

Friends, if a person walks away from God’s way, and you bring him back, that is very good. 🚶‍♂️➡️❌➡️🏠
## James 5:20
When you bring a person back, you help save a life from death. God will cover many wrongs. 🫶🛟💖

Dear friends, do not forget this. For the Lord, 1 day is like 1,000 years, and 1,000 years are like 1 day. ⏰1️⃣0️⃣0️⃣0️⃣🔁
## 2 Peter 3:9
The Lord is not slow. He waits on you all. He is patient. He wants all people to turn to God and live. He does not want any to be lost. ❤️⏳🙂🔄
## 2 Peter 3:10
The Day of the Lord will come fast, like a thief at night. The sky will roar. Sky things will burn. The earth and all we do will be seen. 🌌🌙🕵️🔥
## 2 Peter 3:11
So, since this will end, you all must live clean and good. Be God’s people. Do what is right. 🧼✨🙏
## 2 Peter 3:12
Wait and pray for God’s big day to come soon. The sky will burn. The sky things will melt. ⏳🙏🔥🌠🫠
## 2 Peter 3:13
But God said He will make a new sky and a new earth. We wait for them. There, all is right and good. 🌈🆕🌍😊
## 2 Peter 3:14
Dear friends, as you wait, try hard to live clean. Let Him see you calm and at peace. 💪🧼🕊️
## 2 Peter 3:15
Think of the Lord’s wait as a way to save us. Our brother Paul wrote this too. God gave him wise words. ⏳💖✉️🧠
## 2 Peter 3:16
Paul writes about this in his letters. Some parts are hard. Some people who do not learn twist the words. They hurt themselves. They do this with the Bible too. 📬🤔🔁🚫📖
## 2 Peter 3:17
So, dear friends, be careful. Do not go with people who do not obey. Do not fall. Stay strong with God. 🛑👣💪🙏
## 2 Peter 3:18
Grow in God’s kind gift and in knowing our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Give Him all the praise now and for ever. Amen. 🌱🎁📘✝️🙌∞


## 1 John 1:1
We heard Jesus. We saw Him. We looked at Him. We touched Him. He gives life. 👂👀✋✨
## 1 John 1:2
This life came to us. We saw Him. We tell you all about Him. He was with God. He came to us. 👀➡️🗣️🙌
## 1 John 1:3
We tell you all what we saw and heard. Then you all can be close with us. We are close with God the Father and His Son Jesus. 🗣️👂👀🤝🙏✝️
## 1 John 1:4
We write this so we can be very happy with you all. ✍️😊
## 1 John 1:5
Here is the message we heard from Him: God is light. In God there is no dark at all. ☀️🚫🌑
## 1 John 1:6
If we say we are close with God but walk in the dark, we lie. We do not do what is true. 🚶‍♂️🌑❌🗣️
## 1 John 1:7
If we walk in the light, like He is in the light, we are close with each other. The blood of Jesus, God’s Son, makes us clean from all sin. 🚶‍♂️☀️🤝✝️🩸🧼
## 1 John 1:8
If we say, “We do not sin,” we trick our self. The truth is not in us. 🗣️❌😕
## 1 John 1:9
If we tell God our sins, He always does right. He will forgive us. He will wash us clean from all wrong. 🙏🗣️❤️✅🧼
## 1 John 1:10
If we say, “We did not sin,” we say God lies. His word is not in us. 🗣️❌⚠️📖


## 1 John 2:1
Dear kids, I write to help you not do wrong. But if you do wrong, Jesus helps us with the Father. He always does what is right. 📝👶✝️🙏
## 1 John 2:2
Jesus took the bad for our wrong. He did this for the whole world. ✝️🌍
## 1 John 2:3
We know we know Him when we keep His rules. ✅📖
## 1 John 2:4
If a person says, “I know Him,” but does not keep His rules, that person tells a lie, and the truth is not in him. 🚫🤥
## 1 John 2:5
If a person keeps His word, God’s love is big in that one. Then we know we live in Him. ❤️🏠
## 1 John 2:6
If we say we stay with Him, we must live like Jesus lived. 👣
## 1 John 2:7
Dear ones, this is not a new rule, but an old rule you heard from the start. 🕰️👂
## 1 John 2:8
It is also new now. The dark is going away, and the true light is shining. 🌑➡️🌞
## 1 John 2:9
If someone says, “I am in the light,” but hates his brother, he is still in the dark. 💡❌➡️🌑
## 1 John 2:10
Whoever loves his brother stays in the light, and he will not make others trip. 💡❤️🚶‍♂️
## 1 John 2:11
Whoever hates his brother is in the dark, walks in the dark, and cannot see where to go, because the dark made his eyes blind. 🌑🚶‍♂️🕶️
## 1 John 2:12
Little kids, I write to you, because God forgave your wrongs because of Jesus. 🧒📝🙏
## 1 John 2:13
I write to dads: you know God from the start. I write to young men: you beat the bad one. I write to kids: you know the Father. 👨‍👧‍👦💪👦
## 1 John 2:14
I write to dads: you know God from the start. I write to young men: you are strong, God’s word lives in you, and you beat the bad one. 📖💪
## 1 John 2:15
Do not love this world or its stuff. If you love the world, God’s love is not in you. 🌍❌🧡
## 1 John 2:16
In this world are bad wants of the body, bad wants of the eyes, and the “I am best” feeling; these are not from the Father but from the world. 👀🍰😤
## 1 John 2:17
The world and its bad wants will end, but whoever does what God wants lives with God forever. ⏳➡️♾️🙏
## 1 John 2:18
Kids, it is the last time. You heard a fake teacher against Jesus will come; now many fake ones are here, so we know it is the last time. ⏰⚠️
## 1 John 2:19
They left us. They were not really with us. If they were with us, they would stay. They left to show they were not with us. 🚪👋
## 1 John 2:20
But all of you have a gift from God. God’s Holy Spirit helps you know what is true. 🎁🕊️
## 1 John 2:21
I write to you because you know the truth, and no lie comes from the truth. ✍️✅
## 1 John 2:22
Who is the liar? It is the one who says, “Jesus is not the One God picked.” This one is against Jesus and says “No” to the Father and the Son. ❌✝️
## 1 John 2:23
Whoever says “No” to the Son does not have the Father. Whoever says “Yes” to the Son has the Father too. ✝️👍
## 1 John 2:24
Keep the true word you heard from the start in you. If you keep it, you will stay with the Son and the Father. 🧠💖
## 1 John 2:25
God made a promise to us: life that never ends. 🎁♾️
## 1 John 2:26
I write this about people who try to trick you. 🎭⚠️
## 1 John 2:27
God’s Holy Spirit stays in you and teaches you all you need. He is true, not a lie. So stay with Him. 🕊️📖
## 1 John 2:28
Now, dear kids, stay with Him. When He comes, we will feel brave and will not hide in shame. 🧒💪😊
## 1 John 2:29
You know He is right and good. So you know all who do right are His children. 🤝👨‍👩‍👧‍👦


## 1 John 3:1
John says, Look! God loves us so much. He calls us His kids. 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦❤️ The world does not know us, because it did not know Him. 🌎❓
## 1 John 3:2
Dear ones, we are God’s kids now. We do not know yet what we will be. When Jesus comes, we will be like Him. We will see Him. 👀✨
## 1 John 3:3
All who hope in Jesus try to be clean and good, like He is clean and good. 🧼🙂
## 1 John 3:4
If you do wrong, you break God’s rules. Sin is doing wrong. 🚫
## 1 John 3:5
You know Jesus came to take away our sin. In Him there is no sin. ✝️🧼
## 1 John 3:6
If we live in Him, we do not keep doing wrong. If someone keeps doing wrong, they do not know Him. ↩️🚫
## 1 John 3:7
Dear kids, do not let people trick you. The one who does right is right, like Jesus is right. 👍
## 1 John 3:8
The one who does wrong is with the devil. The devil did wrong from the start. God’s Son came to stop the devil’s work. 😈🛑✝️
## 1 John 3:9
If God makes you new, you do not keep doing wrong, because God’s life is in you. You cannot keep doing wrong, because you are God’s child. 🌱➡️🙂
## 1 John 3:10
This shows who are God’s kids and who are the devil’s kids: the one who does not do right is not with God, and the one who does not love his brother or sister is not with God. ⚖️❤️
## 1 John 3:11
This is the message from the start: love one another. ❤️🤝
## 1 John 3:12
Do not be like Cain. He was with the bad one, and he killed his brother. Why? His works were bad, and his brother’s works were good. ⚠️😢
## 1 John 3:13
Dear family, do not be surprised if the world hates you. 🌎💔
## 1 John 3:14
We know we moved from death to life, because we love our brothers and sisters. The one who does not love stays in death. 🕊️❤️
## 1 John 3:15
If you hate your brother or sister, you are like a killer. A killer does not have life with God that lasts forever. 💔⛔
## 1 John 3:16
We know love, because Jesus gave His life for us. So we should help our brothers and sisters, even when it is hard. ✝️➡️❤️
## 1 John 3:17
If someone has money or stuff and sees a brother or sister in need but does not help, how can God's love be in that person? 💰👀🙅
## 1 John 3:18
Dear kids, do not only say, “I love you.” Show love by what you do. Be true. 👐❤️
## 1 John 3:19
This is how we know we are in the true way. Then our hearts can rest before God. 🧡🕊️
## 1 John 3:20
If our hearts say, “You did wrong,” God is bigger than our hearts. He knows all things. 💭➡️🙏
## 1 John 3:21
Dear ones, if our hearts do not blame us, we can come to God with joy. 😀🙏
## 1 John 3:22
We get what we ask from Him, because we keep His rules and do what makes Him glad. 📝🎁
## 1 John 3:23
This is God’s big rule: believe in His Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, just as He told us. 🙏❤️
## 1 John 3:24
The one who keeps God’s rules stays with God, and God stays with them. We know He stays with us, because He gave us God's Holy Spirit. 🏠🕊️


## 1 John 4:1
John says, “Friends, do not trust every spirit. Test the spirit. Many fake teachers are in the world.” 🛑🔎🌍
## 1 John 4:2
You can know God’s Holy Spirit like this: If a spirit says Jesus came as a real man, it is from God. ✅✝️🙂
## 1 John 4:3
If a spirit will not say Jesus, it is not from God. It is a bad spirit against Jesus. It is here now. ❌👿⏳
## 1 John 4:4
Dear kids, you are from God. You beat the bad ones. God in you is bigger than the bad one in the world. 💪✨🌍
## 1 John 4:5
The bad teachers are from the world. They talk like the world. The world likes what they say. 🗣️🌍👂
## 1 John 4:6
We are from God. People who know God hear us. Others do not. This shows God’s Holy Spirit is true, and the other spirit is wrong. 👂✅🕊️
## 1 John 4:7
Friends, let us love each other. Love comes from God. If you love, you are God’s child and you know God. ❤️👨‍👩‍👧‍👦✨
## 1 John 4:8
If you do not love, you do not know God. God is love. ❤️➡️🕊️
## 1 John 4:9
God’s love showed up like this: God sent His one Son, Jesus, to the world so we can live through Him. 🌍➡️✝️❤️
## 1 John 4:10
This is love: not that we loved God first. God loved us first. He sent His Son Jesus to take away our sin. 💖✝️🧼
## 1 John 4:11
Friends, God loved us, so we must love each other too. 🤝❤️
## 1 John 4:12
No one has seen God. But when we love each other, God lives in us. God’s love grows strong in us. 🫶🏠✨
## 1 John 4:13
We know God lives in us, and we live in God, because He gave us God’s Holy Spirit. 🕊️🏠💖
## 1 John 4:14
We saw it and we tell it: Father God sent His Son Jesus to save the world. 👀🗣️🌍✝️
## 1 John 4:15
If you say, “Jesus is God’s Son,” God lives in you, and you live in God. 🗣️✝️🏠
## 1 John 4:16
We know and trust God’s love for us. God is love. If you live in love, you live in God, and God lives in you. ❤️🏠
## 1 John 4:17
God’s love grows strong in us. So we can be brave on the big day with God. In this world, we live like Jesus. 💖🛡️🌍
## 1 John 4:18
Love is not scared. Strong love pushes scary away. If you feel scared, you think you will be punished. That love is not full yet. 💗🚫😱
## 1 John 4:19
We love because God loved us first. ❤️➡️❤️
## 1 John 4:20
If a person says, “I love God,” but hates his brother or sister, he lies. You can not love God you can not see, if you do not love the person you can see. 🚫❤️👀
## 1 John 4:21
God gave this rule: If you love God, you must also love your brother and sister. 📜❤️👫


## 1 John 5:1
If you believe Jesus is God’s Son, you are God’s kid. If you love God, you will love His Son too. 👶❤️✝️

We know we love God’s kids when we love God and do what He says. 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦❤️✅
## 1 John 5:3
To show God’s love, we keep His rules. His rules are not too hard. ❤️📖🙂
## 1 John 5:4
All God’s kids can win over the bad world. We win by trust in Jesus. 🏆🌎✝️
## 1 John 5:5
Who wins over the world? The one who trusts Jesus, God’s Son. 🥇✝️
## 1 John 5:6
Jesus came with water and blood. Not just water. God’s Holy Spirit says this is true. God’s Holy Spirit tells what is true. 💧🩸🕊️
## 1 John 5:7
There are three who say this is true. 3️⃣✅
## 1 John 5:8
God’s Holy Spirit, the water, and the blood all say the same. They match. 🕊️💧🩸
## 1 John 5:9
We listen to people. But what God says is more. God says true things about His Son. 🗣️➡️🙏
## 1 John 5:10
If you trust God’s Son, you know this inside. If you do not trust God, you say God lies, because you do not believe what He says about His Son. 💓✝️🚫
## 1 John 5:11
Here is what God says: God gave us life forever. This life is in His Son. 🎁❤️⏳✝️
## 1 John 5:12
If you have God’s Son, you have life. If you do not have His Son, you do not have life. ✝️➡️💓 | 🚫✝️➡️🚫💓
## 1 John 5:13
I write this to you all who trust the name of God’s Son. I want you all to know you have life forever. ✍️📜😊
## 1 John 5:14
We are sure when we talk to God: if we ask for what He wants, He hears us. 🙏👂
## 1 John 5:15
If we know He hears us when we ask, we know we get what we asked from Him. 🎁🙏🙂
## 1 John 5:16
If you see a friend do a bad thing that does not lead to death, pray, and God will help that friend live. There is a bad thing that leads to death. I do not say to pray for that. 👀➡️🙏🤝
## 1 John 5:17
All wrong is sin. But some sin does not lead to death. ⚠️
## 1 John 5:18
We know God’s child does not keep doing bad. Jesus keeps God’s child safe. The bad one cannot grab God’s child. 🛡️✝️🙅‍♂️
## 1 John 5:19
We know we are with God. The world is in the hand of the bad one. 🌎✝️🙁
## 1 John 5:20
We know God’s Son came. He helps us know the true God. We live in the true God, in His Son Jesus Christ. He is the true God. He gives life forever. ✝️🔆🏠⏳

## 2 John 1:8
You all be careful. Do not lose what we worked for. Then you will get the full gift. 👀🎁
## 2 John 1:9
If someone does not stay with Jesus’ teaching, that one does not have God. If someone stays with Jesus’ teaching, that one has God the Father and His Son Jesus. 📖✝️
## 2 John 1:10
If someone comes and does not teach the true story of Jesus, do not let this one in your house. Do not say “good job” to this one. 🚪❌

If you help them, you help the bad thing they do. ❌🤝

I wrote to the church. But Diotrephes wants to be first. He will not listen to us. 📝⛪😕

If I come, I will talk about what he did. He says bad words about us. He will not let the brothers in. He stops others who want to help. He even kicks them out of the church. 🗣️❌⛪🚫👎
## 3 John 1:11
Dear friend, do not copy bad. Copy good. If you do good, you are with God. If you do bad, you do not know God. ⚠️👍👎🙏

## Jude 1:18
