Dear Gaius, I talk to God for you. I want you to be well and strong, just like your inside is doing well. 🙏💪🙂

Some brothers came. They said you live by truth. I was very glad to hear this. 🙂🗣️👣
## 3 John 1:4
I am most happy when I hear my dear ones live by truth. 😀👂👣

## 3 John 1:9
I wrote to the church. But Diotrephes wants to be first. He will not listen to us. 📝⛪😕
## 3 John 1:10
If I come, I will talk about what he did. He says bad words about us. He will not let the brothers in. He stops others who want to help. He even kicks them out of the church. 🗣️❌⛪🚫👎
## 3 John 1:11
Dear friend, do not copy bad. Copy good. If you do good, you are with God. If you do bad, you do not know God. ⚠️👍👎🙏

All people say Demetrius is good. The truth says it too. We say it too. You know we say what is true. ⭐✅🗣️
## 3 John 1:13
I have a lot to write. But I do not want to use pen and ink now. ✍️🖊️📝

I hope to see you soon. We will talk face to face. 👀🙂🗣️

Peace to you. Our friends say hi. Say hi to each friend by name. 🕊️👋🏷️
