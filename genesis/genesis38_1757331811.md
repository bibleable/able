## Genesis 38:1
Judah went away from his brothers. He made a friend named Hirah in a place named Adullam. 🚶‍♂️🤝
## Genesis 38:2
Judah saw a woman there. She was Shua’s girl. He made her his wife. 💍🙂
## Genesis 38:3
The wife had a baby boy. Judah named him Er. 👶
## Genesis 38:4

## Genesis 38:5
She had a third baby boy in a town named Chezib. His name was Shelah. 🏠👶
## Genesis 38:6
Judah found a wife for Er. Her name was Tamar. 💍
## Genesis 38:7
Er did very bad. God saw it. Er died. ⚠️
## Genesis 38:8
Judah told Onan to help give a baby for his brother’s name with Tamar. 🗣️
## Genesis 38:9
Onan did not want to do it. He did not do what he was told. ❌
## Genesis 38:10
God saw this. God was not happy. Onan died. ⚠️
## Genesis 38:11
Judah told Tamar, “Go live with your dad. Wait for Shelah to grow up.” She went home. 🏠
## Genesis 38:12
Later, Judah’s wife died. After some time, he felt calm. He and his friend Hirah went to Timnah to cut wool from sheep. 🐑✂️
## Genesis 38:13
Someone told Tamar, “Judah is going to Timnah to cut sheep wool.” 🗣️
## Genesis 38:14
Tamar took off her sad clothes. She covered her face and sat by the road to Timnah. She saw Shelah was big now, but she was not given to him. 🧣🛣️
## Genesis 38:15
Judah saw her and did not know it was Tamar. Her face was covered. He thought she was a stranger. 😕
## Genesis 38:16
Judah went to her and said, “Please be with me.” He did not know she was Tamar. She said, “What will you give me?” 💬
## Genesis 38:17
Judah said, “I will send a young goat.” She said, “Give me a promise now.” 🐐
## Genesis 38:18
She said, “Give me your ring, your rope, and your stick.” He gave them. Later, she had a baby inside. 💍🪢🪵👶
## Genesis 38:19
Tamar went home. She took off the cover and put on her sad clothes again. 🏠🧣
## Genesis 38:20
Judah sent his friend with the goat to get back the ring, rope, and stick. But the woman was not there. 🐐
## Genesis 38:21
The friend asked the people, “Where is the woman who was by the road?” They said, “No woman like that was here.” 🧑‍🤝‍🧑
## Genesis 38:22
The friend went back and said, “I did not find her. The people said no woman like that was there.” ↩️
## Genesis 38:23
Judah said, “Let her keep the things. I do not want people to laugh at us. I sent the goat, but we did not find her.” 😬
## Genesis 38:24
Three months later, people said, “Tamar is going to have a baby.” Judah said, “Bring her here. Punish her very hard.” ⚠️
## Genesis 38:25
As they took her out, Tamar sent a message: “I have a baby from the man who owns this ring, rope, and stick.” 📝💍🪢🪵
## Genesis 38:26
Judah saw the things and said, “She is more right than me. I did not give her to Shelah.” He did not be with her again. 👍
## Genesis 38:27
Time came. Tamar had two babies inside. 👶👶
## Genesis 38:28
One baby put out a hand. A helper tied a red string and said, “This one is first.” 🧵🔴
## Genesis 38:29
Then the hand went back. The other baby came out first. They said, “Wow, you pushed out!” They named him Perez. 🍼
## Genesis 38:30
Then the baby with the red string came out. They named him Zerah. 🎀👶
