## Zephaniah 3:1
God says, Bad city! You are mean. You hurt people. 😠🏙️
## Zephaniah 3:2
You do not listen. You do not learn. You do not trust God. You do not come near to Him. 🙉🚫🙏
## Zephaniah 3:3
Your leaders are like loud lions. Your judges are like wild wolves. They take all; nothing is left. 🦁🐺🍽️
## Zephaniah 3:4
Your teachers tell lies. Your priests break God’s rules. They hurt what is right. 🚫🗣️✝️
## Zephaniah 3:5
But God is in the city. He is good. He does right each day. Bad people do not feel bad. 🌅✨
## Zephaniah 3:6
God says: I took down other lands. I made their towns empty. No one walks there now. 🏚️🚫👣
## Zephaniah 3:7
God says: I hoped you would listen and be good. But you did more bad. 😞➡️😠
## Zephaniah 3:8
God says: Wait for Me. I will bring all lands. I will show My anger. The earth will feel it like fire. ⏳🌍🔥
## Zephaniah 3:9
Then I will make people talk clean. All will call to God. All will work together for Him. 🗣️🧼🤝
## Zephaniah 3:10
People far away will come to Me. They will bring gifts to God. 🌏➡️🙏🎁
## Zephaniah 3:11
On that day you will not feel shame. I will take away the proud. No more bragging on My special hill. 😊⛰️
## Zephaniah 3:12
I will keep gentle, small people. They will run to God for help. 🫶🧒🙏
## Zephaniah 3:13
My people will not do wrong or tell lies. They will rest like sheep. No one will scare them. 🐑😴🛡️
## Zephaniah 3:14
People in the city, sing! My people, shout! Be glad! Be happy! 🎶🙌😀
## Zephaniah 3:15
God took away the bad news. He pushed away your enemies. God your King is with you. Do not fear bad. 👑🛡️🚫😨
## Zephaniah 3:16
That day people will say, City, do not fear. Do not be weak. 💪🙂
## Zephaniah 3:17
God is with you. He is strong. He will save you. He is happy with you. He will calm you with God’s love. He will sing over you. 🫶💖🎵
## Zephaniah 3:18
God says: I will bring in the sad ones who missed the big days. You will not be picked on. 😢➡️🤗
## Zephaniah 3:19
Look! I will stop the mean ones. I will help the hurt ones. I will bring in the left-out ones. I will turn shame to praise. People will say good things about you. ✋😡➡️🩹🤝👏
## Zephaniah 3:20
At that time I will bring you home. All people will praise you. I will make things good again for you, and you will see it. God says this. 🏠🌍👏
