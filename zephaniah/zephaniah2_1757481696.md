## Zephaniah 2:1
All you people, come close. You did not say sorry to God. 📣👥
## Zephaniah 2:2
Come now, before the bad day comes, before God gets mad. ⏰⚠️
## Zephaniah 2:3
Look for God. Do right. Be kind and low. Maybe God will hide you on the bad day. 🙏✅🫶🛡️
## Zephaniah 2:4
Gaza will be empty. Ashkelon will be empty. At noon, Ashdod will be pushed out. Ekron will be pulled up. 🏙️➡️🚫
## Zephaniah 2:5
Bad news for sea towns, Cherethites. God says to Canaan, land of the Philistines: I will stop you. No one will live there. 🌊⚠️
## Zephaniah 2:6
The sea land will be grass fields. Sheep helpers will rest there. Flocks will have yards. 🌾🐑
## Zephaniah 2:7
The sea land will be for the small group of Judah. They will feed sheep there and sleep in Ashkelon at night. God will think of them and give back good. 🌊🐑🌙
## Zephaniah 2:8
God says: I heard Moab and Ammon say mean words. They made fun of my people and bragged about the land. 👂😠🗣️
## Zephaniah 2:9
God says: As I live, Moab will be like Sodom. Ammon will be like Gomorrah. The land will have salt and be waste. My people who live will take it. 🧂🏜️
## Zephaniah 2:10
This will come because they were proud and bragged at God’s people. 😑📣
## Zephaniah 2:11
God will show He is big. He will make false gods weak. All people in all lands will bow to God. 🌍🙇
## Zephaniah 2:12
God says to Cush: You too will be stopped by my sword. ⚔️
## Zephaniah 2:13
God will reach to the north. He will end Assyria. Nineveh will be like a dry desert. 🧭❌🏜️
## Zephaniah 2:14
Animals will sleep in that city. Birds will sit in the windows. The wood will show, and the place will be empty. 🐄🕊️🏚️
## Zephaniah 2:15
This city once said, “I am the best. No one else.” Now it is empty. Wild animals live there. People who pass hiss and shake a fist. 🗣️➡️🏚️🐺👊
