The Teacher says: Who is wise? A wise one knows what to do. Being wise makes your face kind and bright. 😊💡
## Ecclesiastes 8:2
The Teacher says: Obey the king. You made a promise to God to obey. 👑✋🙏
## Ecclesiastes 8:3
Do not run from the king. Do not help with bad plans. The king can do what he wants. 🚫🏃‍♂️👑
## Ecclesiastes 8:4
When the king speaks, it happens. No one can say, “Why do that?” 👑🗣️➡️✅
## Ecclesiastes 8:5

There is a right time for each thing. But people have many hard things to carry. ⏰😣
## Ecclesiastes 8:7
No one knows what will come next. No one can tell it. 🤷‍♂️❓

## Ecclesiastes 8:9
The Teacher saw this: some people hurt others when they have power. 👀💔
## Ecclesiastes 8:10
The Teacher saw bad men die and get put in the ground. People in the town said nice words about them, but they did bad. This is not good. ⚰️🏘️

When bad people are not stopped fast, other people want to do bad too. 🐢🚫➡️😞
## Ecclesiastes 8:12
A bad man may do bad many times and live long. But I know it will be good for people who fear God and obey Him. 🙏😇

It will not be good for bad people. Their joy will not last long, because they do not fear God. 🚫🙂⏳
## Ecclesiastes 8:14
On earth, good people sometimes get bad things. Bad people sometimes get good things. This feels not fair. 🤔⚖️
## Ecclesiastes 8:15
So I say: enjoy life. Eat and drink. Be glad in your work. God gives these days. 🍞🥤😊

I tried to learn all the things people do on earth. I stayed up day and night. 👀🌞🌙
## Ecclesiastes 8:17
I saw God’s work is so big. People cannot know it all. Even a wise one cannot know it all. 🌍🙇‍♂️
