## Micah 7:1
I am very sad. I look for fruit, but there is no fruit. I want one good fruit, but there is none. 🍇😢
## Micah 7:2
Good people are gone. No one does right. People plan to hurt and set traps. ⚠️🪤
## Micah 7:3
People work hard to do bad. Leaders and the judge take gifts. Big men ask for what they want. All make a bad plan. 😠💰
## Micah 7:4
The best of them is like a sharp thorn. A day will come when they get in trouble. Then they will be very confused. 🌵⏰😕
## Micah 7:5
Do not trust a friend. Do not trust a leader. Be quiet even with your wife. 🤫
## Micah 7:6
Sons and dads fight. Daughters and moms fight. People in one home fight. 😢🏠
## Micah 7:7
But I will look to God. I will wait for God to save me. My God will hear me. 🙏⏳
## Micah 7:8
Do not laugh at me, enemy. If I fall, I will stand again. If it is dark, God is my light. 💪🌟
## Micah 7:9
I did wrong. God is mad at me. I will take it. God will stand up for me. He will bring me to light. I will see He is right. 😔➡️🌅
## Micah 7:10
My enemy will see this. She said, “Where is your God?” She will feel very bad. She will be like mud in the street. 👀🗣️➡️😞🪣
## Micah 7:11
One day the wall will be built. The bad rules will go far away. 🧱🚫
## Micah 7:12
On that day, people will come to you from far places, from sea to sea, and from hill to hill. 🌊⛰️🚶
## Micah 7:13
But the land will be empty and sad, because of the bad things people did. 🌾💔
## Micah 7:14
God, please care for Your people like sheep. Let them eat in good fields, on Carmel, in Bashan and Gilead, like long ago. 🐑🌿
## Micah 7:15
God will show big things, like when He took you out of Egypt. 🌊✨
## Micah 7:16
Other lands will see. They will be very surprised. They will cover their mouth. Their ears will not hear. 😮🤐
## Micah 7:17
They will crawl low like snakes. They will come shaking to God. They will be afraid of God and of you. 🐍😨
## Micah 7:18
God, no one is like You. You forgive bad things. You love to be kind. 💖🙌
## Micah 7:19
God will come help again. He will push our bad away. He will throw our bad into the deep sea. 🌊🗑️
## Micah 7:20
God will keep His true word to Jacob. God will be kind, like He said to Abraham long ago. 📜✅
