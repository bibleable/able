## Hebrews 3:1
Dear God friends, God called you. Think about Jesus. He is the One God sent. He helps us talk to God. 🙏👀
## Hebrews 3:2
Jesus did the work God gave Him. He did it all. Moses did that too, in God’s house. ✅🏠
## Hebrews 3:3
Jesus is greater than Moses. The one who builds a house is greater than the house. ⭐🏠
## Hebrews 3:4
A house has a builder. God made all things. 🏠🧱🌟
## Hebrews 3:5
Moses was a good helper in God’s house. He told of things that would come later. 🧔📖
## Hebrews 3:6
But Jesus is God’s Son. He is over God’s house. We are His house if we keep on trusting Him to the end. 👑🏠❤️
## Hebrews 3:7
God’s Holy Spirit says, “Today, if you all hear His voice, listen.” 🕊️👂
## Hebrews 3:8
Do not make your hearts hard. Do not fight God, like long ago in the desert. ❌💔🏜️
## Hebrews 3:9
Long ago your dads tested Me. They saw the big things I did for 40 years. ⏳👀
## Hebrews 3:10
So I was not happy with that group. They go the wrong way. They did not know My way. 🚫➡️
## Hebrews 3:11
So I said, “They will not come in to My rest.” 🚫🛌
## Hebrews 3:12
Friends, watch out. Do not let your heart be bad and not believe. Do not walk away from the living God. 👀❤️🚶‍♂️❌
## Hebrews 3:13
But help each other every day while it is Today. Say kind words, so bad sin will not trick you. 🤝🗣️🙂
## Hebrews 3:14
We share with Jesus if we keep our first trust to the end. 🤗✝️
## Hebrews 3:15
As God said, “Today, if you all hear His voice, do not make your hearts hard.” 📣💗
## Hebrews 3:16
Some heard God and still fought Him. Not all who left Egypt with Moses did that. 👂➡️✊
## Hebrews 3:17
Who was God upset with for 40 years? With the ones who did bad. They fell in the desert. 😟🏜️
## Hebrews 3:18
Who did God say could not come into His rest? The ones who did not believe. 🚫🛌
## Hebrews 3:19
So they could not go in, because they did not believe. 🚪❌
