## Galatians 4:1
Paul said: A child who will get the home is like a worker for now. He is not free yet. 👦🏠⏳
## Galatians 4:2
The child must obey helpers and a teacher until Dad says, “Now.” 👨‍👩‍👦🧑‍🏫🗓️
## Galatians 4:3
We were like kids too. Old rules held us like a chain. ⛓️👧👦
## Galatians 4:4
When the time was just right, God sent His Son, Jesus. He was born as a baby. ⏰👶✝️
## Galatians 4:5
Jesus came to set us free and make us God’s kids. Jesus is God’s Son. Jesus loves us. 🕊️❤️
## Galatians 4:6
God sent God’s Holy Spirit into your hearts. We cry, “Abba, Father!” 💖🕊️🗣️
## Galatians 4:7
You are not a slave now. You are God’s child. You will get His good gifts. 😀🎁
## Galatians 4:8
Before, you did not know God. You served things that were not God. 😕🛑
## Galatians 4:9
Now you know God, and God knows you. Why go back to small, weak rules? 🔁❌
## Galatians 4:10
You watch special days and months and times and years like they can save you. 📅🗓️⛔
## Galatians 4:11
I am afraid my work for you may be for nothing. 😟
## Galatians 4:12
Friends, be like me. I was like you. You did not hurt me. 🤝🙂
## Galatians 4:13
You know I was sick when I came. I told you the good news then. 🤒🗣️
## Galatians 4:14
You did not make fun of me. You were kind. You welcomed me like an angel, like I was with Jesus. 😊👼
## Galatians 4:15
Where is your joy now? Back then you would give me your eyes if you could. 😢👀
## Galatians 4:16
Am I your enemy now because I tell you the truth? 😔
## Galatians 4:17
Those people are nice to you, but not to help you. They want to pull you away. They want you to like them most. 🚫🧲
## Galatians 4:18
It is good to be excited for a good thing, not just when I am there. 👍😊
## Galatians 4:19
My little ones, I hurt like a mom having a baby, until Jesus grows in you. 👶💗
## Galatians 4:20
I wish I was there with you now. I would talk soft. I do not know what to do. 🙏🤷
## Galatians 4:21
You who want the old rules, listen to what the Book says. 📖👂
## Galatians 4:22
Long ago, a man named Abraham had two sons. One mom was a helper. One mom was free. 👨‍👩‍👦‍👦
## Galatians 4:23
The helper mom had a boy in the normal way. The free mom had a boy because God made a promise. 👶✨
## Galatians 4:24
This is like a picture: the helper mom shows a life with hard rules that makes people not free. 🧱⛓️
## Galatians 4:25
That rule life makes many kids not free. They feel stuck. 🚫⛓️
## Galatians 4:26
But the free mom is like a picture of God’s home above. She is free. We are her kids. 🕊️🏠⬆️
## Galatians 4:27
The Book says, “Be glad, mom with no kids. You will have many kids.” 🎉👩‍🍼
## Galatians 4:28
Family, you are like Isaac. You are kids of God’s promise. 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦🌟
## Galatians 4:29
Back then, the helper mom’s boy was mean to the free mom’s boy. Now it is like that too. 😠➡️😢
## Galatians 4:30
The Book says, “Send the helper mom and her boy away. The free mom’s boy gets the gift.” 🚪🎁
## Galatians 4:31
So, family, we are not kids of the helper. We are kids of the free mom. We are free in Jesus. 🕊️❤️
