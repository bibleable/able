## Galatians 2:1
After 14 years, Paul went to Jerusalem with Barnabas. He took Titus too. 🚶‍♂️🏙️👬
## Galatians 2:2
God told Paul to go. Paul told the big helpers the Good News he tells to not-Jew people. He spoke in a small, quiet group to check his work. 🗣️🤝🔍
## Galatians 2:3
They did not make Titus do the old body rule. ✅🙂
## Galatians 2:4
Some fake friends came in like sneaks. They tried to take our free life in Jesus and make us follow old rules. 🕵️‍♂️🔒
## Galatians 2:5
We did not give in. Not even a little. We kept the true Good News for you. ⛔💪📖
## Galatians 2:6
The big leaders did not change Paul’s message. God does not pick favorites. 🤝⚖️
## Galatians 2:7
They saw God gave Paul work to tell not-Jew people. Peter would tell Jew people. 👥➡️🌍✡️
## Galatians 2:8
God helped Peter with Jew people. God helped Paul with not-Jew people too. 🙌✨
## Galatians 2:9
James, Peter (also called Cephas), and John saw God helped Paul. They shook hands with Paul and Barnabas. Paul would go to not-Jew people. They would go to Jew people. 🤝🙂🌎✡️
## Galatians 2:10
They said, “Please help poor people.” Paul wanted to do this. 🧺🤲❤️
## Galatians 2:11
Peter came to Antioch. Paul told Peter to his face, “You are wrong.” ⚠️👥
## Galatians 2:12
Before men from James came, Peter ate with not-Jew friends. When they came, he pulled away. He was scared of the old rule group. 🍽️➡️🚶‍♂️😟
## Galatians 2:13
Other Jew friends did the same fake thing. Even Barnabas followed them. 😕➡️👥
## Galatians 2:14
Paul saw they did not live the true Good News. He said to Peter in front of all, “You are a Jew but you live like not-Jews. Do not make not-Jews live like Jews.” 🗣️👥📢
## Galatians 2:15
We are Jews. We are not from the not-Jew group people call bad. 👥✡️
## Galatians 2:16
We know God makes us right, not by old rules, but when we trust Jesus Christ. So we trust Jesus. No one is made right by old rules. ❤️✝️✅
## Galatians 2:17
If we look to Jesus to make us right and we still do wrong, does Jesus lead us to wrong? No! ❓✝️🚫
## Galatians 2:18
If I go back and build the old rule life, I show I am the rule breaker. 🔁🏗️⚠️
## Galatians 2:19
The old rules showed me I cannot be saved by them. So I stopped living by old rules. Now I live for God. 📜✝️➡️🙏
## Galatians 2:20
I died with Jesus on the cross. Now Jesus lives in me. My life now is by trust in God’s Son. He loved me. He gave His life for me. ✝️❤️🙏
## Galatians 2:21
I do not push away God’s gift. If old rules could make us right, then Jesus died for nothing. 🎁✝️
