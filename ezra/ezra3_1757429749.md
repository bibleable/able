## Ezra 3:1
It was month seven. All the people came as one to the big city, Jerusalem. 🏙️👨‍👩‍👧‍👦
## Ezra 3:2
Jeshua and the priests, and Zerubbabel and his family, built a big table for God. They gave fire gifts to God, like the book of Moses says. 🔨🔥🙏
## Ezra 3:3
They put the big table in its place. They were scared of the people around them, but they still gave fire gifts to God in the morning and at night. 🌅🔥🌙
## Ezra 3:4
They had a happy week to thank God, like the book says. Each day they gave gifts to God. 😀🎉🙏
## Ezra 3:5
They kept the daily gifts. They gave gifts on special days too. Each person who wanted to give, gave to God. 🎁🙏
## Ezra 3:6
This started on day one of month seven. The floor of God’s house was not built yet. ⛪🧱
## Ezra 3:7
They gave money to stone workers and wood workers. They gave food, drink, and oil to people by the sea. These people brought big trees by boat. King Cyrus said this was ok. 💰🪵⛵
## Ezra 3:8
In year two, month two, Zerubbabel and Jeshua started the work. The priests, helpers, and all who came back helped. They chose helpers age 20 and up to lead the work. 🛠️🙌
## Ezra 3:9
Jeshua and his sons and brothers led. Kadmiel and his sons led too. The sons of Henadad led too. They were helpers of God. 👨‍👦‍👦👨‍👦‍👦
## Ezra 3:10
The workers made the floor for God’s house. The priests wore special clothes and blew horns. The helper singers hit loud music things. They stood to sing thanks to God, like King David said long ago. 🎺🥁🎶
## Ezra 3:11
They sang, “God is good. God’s love lasts for ever for Israel.” All the people shouted loud to God, because the floor of God’s house was made. 🎵🙌
## Ezra 3:12
But many old men cried loud. They saw the first house long ago. Now they saw the new floor. Many other people shouted with joy. 😢😀
## Ezra 3:13
The happy shouts and the loud cries mixed. It was hard to tell the sounds. The sound was very loud. People far away could hear. 📣👂
