## 1 Samuel 2:11
Elkanah went home to Ramah. The boy Samuel helped God with Eli, God’s helper. 🏠👦⛺️
## 1 Samuel 2:12
Eli’s sons were bad. They did not know God. 😠
## 1 Samuel 2:13
When people gave a gift to God, a man of Eli came with a fork. He put the fork in the pot. 🍲🍴
## 1 Samuel 2:14
He took all the fork pulled up. He did this to all who gave a gift to God at the tent. 🍖➡️😬
## 1 Samuel 2:15
Before the fat was burned for God, the man said, Give meat to Eli’s men to roast. Do not give cooked meat. Give not cooked meat now. 🔥❌🍖
## 1 Samuel 2:16
If a person said, Let the fat burn for God first, the man said, No, give it now, or I will take it by force. 💢✋
## 1 Samuel 2:17
So the young men did a very bad sin to God. They did not care about gifts to God. 🚫🧍‍♂️🧍‍♂️

## 1 Samuel 2:23
Eli said, Why do you do these bad things? I hear of your bad ways from all the people. 🗣️🚫
## 1 Samuel 2:24
No, my sons. This is not good news. You make God’s people do wrong. 🙅‍♂️😔
## 1 Samuel 2:25
If a man hurts a man, God can judge it; but if you sin against God, who can speak for you? They did not listen to Eli, for God planned to punish them. ⚖️👂❌
## 1 Samuel 2:26
Samuel grew bigger. God and people liked him. 😊⬆️
## 1 Samuel 2:27
A man from God came to Eli and said, God says: I showed My power to your family back in Egypt. 🧍‍♂️➡️🗣️🇪🇬
