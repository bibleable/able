## Malachi 3:1
God says, I will send My helper to make the way ready. Then God will come fast to His house. The helper with the promise will come. 🚶‍♂️🛣️🏠⚡
## Malachi 3:2
Who can stand when God comes? He is like hot fire and strong soap. He will make people clean. 🔥🧼
## Malachi 3:3
God will make the church helpers clean, like gold and silver. Then they will bring good gifts to God. 🔥🥇🥈🎁
## Malachi 3:4
Then the gifts from the people will make God glad, like long ago. 🎁🙂⏳
## Malachi 3:5
God says, I will come near and say what is right. I am against bad magic, people who break marry, people who tell lies, people who do not pay workers, people who hurt sad moms and kids with no dad, and people who push away new people. They do not fear God. 👀⚖️🚫🧙‍♂️💔🤥💸👩‍🦰👧🚶‍♂️
## Malachi 3:6
God says, I do not change. So you are kept safe. 🧱✅
## Malachi 3:7
A long time you did not do what God said. Come back to Me, and I will come back to you, God says. You ask, “How do we come back?” ↩️❤️❓
## Malachi 3:8
Can a man steal from God? You steal from God. You ask, “How?” You do not bring the gifts and money for God. 🚫👜💰🎁
## Malachi 3:9
All of you are in trouble, because you steal from God. ⚠️😟
## Malachi 3:10
Bring all the gifts to God’s house, so there is food there. Test God in this. God will open the sky and pour good on you, so you have more than enough. 🏠🍞🌤️🌧️🎁😊
## Malachi 3:11
God will stop the bug that eats your food. Your plants and vines will grow well. 🐛✋🌾🍇👍
## Malachi 3:12
All lands will say you are happy. Your land will be nice and full of joy. 🌍😊🌳🎉
## Malachi 3:13
God says, You spoke mean to Me. You ask, “How did we do that?” 🗣️😠❓
## Malachi 3:14
You said, “It is no use to serve God. We get no good. We act sad for God, but why?” 😒🙅‍♂️😢❓
## Malachi 3:15
You say, “Bad proud people win. Bad people test God and do not get in trouble.” 😤💰🏃‍♂️🚫⚖️
## Malachi 3:16
But some people love and obey God. They talked to each other. God heard them. A book was made to write their names, the ones who love God’s name. 👥❤️🙏👂📖✍️
## Malachi 3:17
God says, “They are Mine. On My day, I will keep them like My special treasure. I will spare them, like a dad spares a good son.” 👑💎👨‍👦💖
## Malachi 3:18
Then you will see the difference. Good people serve God. Bad people do not. 👀➗🙂😞🙏🚫
