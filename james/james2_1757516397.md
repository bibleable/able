## James 2:1
James says, Do not pick some people as best. You trust our Lord Jesus. He is great. ✝️✨
## James 2:2
James says, A rich man with a gold ring and nice clothes comes in. A poor man with old clothes comes in too. 💍👔🧥
## James 2:3
You give the rich man the good seat, but you tell the poor man, “Stand” or “Sit on the floor.” 🪑➡️🧍‍♂️🧎‍♂️
## James 2:4
James says, That is not fair. You think wrong thoughts. 🙅‍♂️🧠
## James 2:5
Listen, friends. God picks many poor people to trust Him. They get His happy home He said He will give to people who love Him. 🏠💖
## James 2:6
But you were not kind to the poor. The rich are mean to you. They take you to the court. 😠⚖️
## James 2:7
They say bad words about Jesus’ good name. That is not okay. 🚫🗣️✝️
## James 2:8
God’s big rule says, Love your friend next door like you love you. If you do this, you do well. ❤️🤝
## James 2:9
But if you pick who is best, you do wrong. You broke God’s rule. ❌📜
## James 2:10
If you keep all the rules but break one small one, you still broke the rule. 🧩⚠️
## James 2:11
God said, Do not break your marry promise. God also said, Do not kill. If you do not break your marry promise but you kill, you still broke God’s rule. 💔❌🗡️
## James 2:12
So say good and do good. God will look at what you do. 🗣️👍
## James 2:13
If you are not kind, you will not be shown kind. But being kind wins! 😊🏆
## James 2:14
My friend, if you say, “I trust God,” but you do not help, can that help you? No. 🙅‍♂️🤲
## James 2:15
If a friend has no coat and no food, 🧥❌🍞❌
## James 2:16
And you say, “Bye, be warm, eat well,” but you do not give a coat or food, that is no good. 🖐️🥶🍽️❌
## James 2:17
So trust with no help is dead. ⚰️
## James 2:18
You say, “I trust.” I say, “I help.” Show your trust by what you do. I will show my trust by my help. 🫶🤝
## James 2:19
You say, “I know God is one.” Good. Bad angels know this too, and they shake. 😨
## James 2:20
Do you see now? Trust with no help does nothing. 🛑
## James 2:21
Abraham, our helper long ago, obeyed God. He put his son Isaac on the wood for God. 👴🧒🪵
## James 2:22
He trusted God and he acted. His trust and his act worked together. 🤝
## James 2:23
The Book said, “Abraham trusted God.” God was happy with him. He was called God’s friend. 📖😊
## James 2:24
So a person is shown right by what they do and by trust, not by trust alone. ✅🤲
## James 2:25
Rahab was a woman in that city. She helped God’s men. She hid them and sent them out safe. God was happy with her. 🏠🤫➡️🏃‍♂️
## James 2:26
A body with no breath is dead. Trust with no help is dead. 🫁❌⚰️
