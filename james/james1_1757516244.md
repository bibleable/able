## James 1:1
James writes. He helps God and the Lord Jesus. He says hi to God’s people far away. ✉️🙋‍♂️✝️
## James 1:2
Be glad when hard days come. They help you grow strong. 😊⛰️
## James 1:3
You know hard time tests your trust. It makes you strong to keep going. 💪
## James 1:4
Keep going till the end. Then you will grow good and not miss any good thing. 🎯🌱
## James 1:5
If you need to know what to do, ask God. He gives to all. He is kind. 🙏🎁
## James 1:6
But when you ask, trust God. Do not wobble like waves in the sea and wind. 🌊💨
## James 1:7
If you are unsure like that, do not think you will get what you ask. 🤔🚫
## James 1:8
A person who cannot choose is not steady in all he does. ↔️🚶‍♂️
## James 1:9
A poor brother can be glad, for God lifts him up. 😊⬆️
## James 1:10
A rich man should feel small, for his rich can go away like a grass flower. 🌼🍃
## James 1:11
The hot sun dries the grass; the flower falls; its pretty look is gone. So the rich man will be gone while he is busy. ☀️🌾🌸➡️🍂
## James 1:12
Happy is the one who keeps going in hard time. God will give life like a bright crown to those who love Him. 😊👑❤️
## James 1:13
When you want to do wrong, do not say, “God makes me do it.” God does not do wrong. He does not make us do wrong. 🚫😈
## James 1:14
We each want wrong things inside. That want pulls us to do wrong. 🎣💔
## James 1:15
Bad want makes sin. Sin grows up. Sin brings death. 🌱➡️🍂⚰️
## James 1:16
My dear family, do not be tricked. 🚫🎭
## James 1:17
All good gifts come from God in heaven. He made the lights in the sky. He does not change. No dark is in Him. 🎁⬇️✨
## James 1:18
God chose to make us new by His true word. He wants us to be His best kids. 📖💡👶
## James 1:19
Be fast to listen. Be slow to talk. Be slow to get mad. 👂🏃‍♂️🗣️🐢😠🐢
## James 1:20
Man anger does not make the right life God wants. 😠🚫✅
## James 1:21
Say no to all bad and dirty ways. Take in God’s word with a soft heart. It can save you. 🗑️🧼❤️📖
## James 1:22
Do what God says. Do not only hear. Do not trick your self. 👂➕👣
## James 1:23
If you hear but do not do, you are like a man who looks in a mirror. 🪞👀
## James 1:24
He looks, then leaves, and he forgets his face. 🚶‍♂️🧠❌
## James 1:25
But if you look at God’s good way and keep on, and you do it, God will make it good for you. 👀📖➡️👣😊
## James 1:26
If you think you love God but do not hold your tongue, you fool your heart. Your worship is no good. 👅❌❤️
## James 1:27
True worship that God our Father likes is this: help kids with no mom or dad, and help women with no husband. Keep your self clean from bad in the world. 🤝👦👧👩🧼🌍
