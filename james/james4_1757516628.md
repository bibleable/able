## James 4:1
James asks, “Why do you all fight?” It is from bad wants inside you all. ⚔️😠
## James 4:2
You all want but do not have. You hurt and fight. You still do not have, because you do not ask God. 😣🤛🙏
## James 4:3
You ask but do not get, because you ask for fun things just for you. 🎁🍬
## James 4:4
You all act like bad friends to God. If you love the world’s bad ways, you are not God’s friend. 💔🌍
## James 4:5
Do you think the Book says nothing? God’s Holy Spirit in us wants us close to God. 💖🔥
## James 4:6
But God gives more help. God says He pushes proud people away, but He helps humble people. 🛑😏 🤝😌
## James 4:7
So listen to God. Say no to the devil. He will run away. 🙏🙅‍♂️😈🏃‍♂️
## James 4:8
Come near to God, and He will come near to you. Wash your hands clean. Make your hearts clean. Do not try to be both good and bad. 🚰🖐️❤️
## James 4:9
Be sad for your sin. Cry and be sorry. Stop silly laughs. Be sad now. 😢😭
## James 4:10
Be humble before the Lord. He will lift you up. 🙇‍♀️⬆️
## James 4:11
Brothers and sisters, do not talk bad about each other. If you do, you act like the boss of God’s rules. 🗣️🚫📜
## James 4:12
God is the only boss of right and wrong. He can save or stop. You are not the boss. Do not say others are bad. 👑⚖️
## James 4:13
Listen, you who say, “Today or tomorrow we will go to a town and make money.” 🗺️🏙️💰
## James 4:14
You do not know about tomorrow. Your life is short, like a small puff, then it is gone. ☁️⏳
## James 4:15
You should say, “If the Lord wants, we will live and do it.” 🙏🗓️
## James 4:16
But now you brag and are too proud. This brag is bad. 😏📢🚫
## James 4:17
If you know the good thing to do and do not do it, that is sin. ✅➡️🚫
